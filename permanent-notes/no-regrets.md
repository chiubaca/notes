I've realised the main source of my anxiety is due to me questioning every action I take.

What if did more?
What if I bout more?
What if tried harder?
What if I took the other job?
What if I made the wrong choice?
What if this.
What if that.

What I've realised what truly matters is not the choice you take, but how you live with the choice you made. We don't always make the optimal choice, we cant. 

What we can control is acceptance and be headstrong with our choice.

Live life with no regrets.
