I've realised the main source of my anxiety is due to me questioning every action I take.

What if did more?
What if tried harder?
What if I bout more Bitcoin?
What if I took the other job?
What if I made the wrong choice?
What if this.
What if that.

What I've realised is not what if. But how you live with the action you made and move forward. We don't always make the optimal choice, we cant. 

What we can control is acceptance and be headstrong with our choice.

Live life with no regrets.
