This is technique to write notes in a way that optimises for discoverability of previously written notes.

There are three types of notes:

## `Fleeting Notes`

- Quick notes for passing thoughts, or from something that you listened to, read or watched.

## `Literature Notes`

- Used to expand upon a certain article/blog/video/podcast etc... for your own personal insights.
- It should be your take on the thing you just consumed
- It should link back to any corresponding fleeting note.
- It's OK for the literature note to have the same title as your fleeting note

## `Permanent Notes`

- This should be the end blog or article that you want to publish and show to the world.
- It should draw upon all the literature notes that you have consumed.
- This can be a topic that over-arches multiple literature notes

By using this note-taking technique, we can consume lots of different types of content. It's important to covert fleeting notes to literature notes as often as possible to start building connections between topics. This could spark an idea for a permanent note
