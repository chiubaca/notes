As with most developers right now, all we're thinking about right now is AI. I've been feeling  _really_ anxious about the state of things. My colleagues and friends are on all spectrums with how they feel about how AI change things. Some totally skeptical and find it useless. Others are complete maximalist and are all in. So with me, I'm trying to strike somewhere in the middle.  

Listening to [Ilya Sutskever](https://www.reddit.com/r/ControlProblem/comments/1ptter6/ilya_sutskever_the_moment_ai_can_do_every_job/) on the subject matter of the future of our jobs now that AI seemingly knows _everything_. Now is time to simply just use these tools, build the intuition and understand the ergonomics. As a software developer in someones nothing has changed. We look at problems and see how we can resolve them. It's just the how-we-get-there has changed significantly. 

So over this xmas break I've finally had some time to test Claude Code and Open Code with various models its been a lot of fun. They hype is really. I've had my "oh-shit wow" moments , felt a bit scared but mostly just impressed.

I built my new app [chonk-poker](https://chonk-poker.chiubaca.com/). Its a planning poker game that uses the [chonk scale](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/99lc07/where_is_your_kitty_on_the_chonk_chart/). This is is how we size tickets at work now and its hilarious because every one keeps forgetting what size is what and we just count to three and post it in a google meet chat. this stupid app is to solve that particular problem in my team. 

It was good oppurtunity to mess around with a whole bunch of new tech too, nameley tanstack-start
