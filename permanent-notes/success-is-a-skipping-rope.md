Sometimes, It's hard to get going. 

The two most important traits that I have found for being productive in life are **grit** and **discipline**, and they're intertwined.

You need grit to grow discipline. You fall back on your discipline when you run out of grit. 

This cycle is like a skipping rope. Grit makes you take the first jump and with every swing of the rope your discipline grows. Continually skipping develops an inertia of productivity, the more you skip, the more you _want_ to skip.

But now and then, the rope hits our feet and we lose all that momentum. 

Grit is what makes us start again, but discipline is what keeps us trying over and over.
