It's hard to get going sometimes, the two most important traits that I have found so far is grit and discipline, but they're intertwined.

You need grit to develop discipline, but you fall back on your discipline when you run out of grit. 

To get into that cycle feels a lot like skipping rope. Grit makes you jump into the rope and with every swing, the inertia of developing grit and discipline gets stronger. 

But every now and then the rope hits our feet and we lose all that momentum. 

Grit is what makes us start again, but discipline is what keep us trying over and over again.
