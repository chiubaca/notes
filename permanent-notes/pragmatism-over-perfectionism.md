A perfectionist is often linked to imposter syndrome.

A perfectionist struggles to start. They get stuck think about the work and delaying the feeling that things wont be pefect

A pragmatist will just get the job done.

Being a pragmatist will let you get more work done and stop feeling like an imposter.
