What is important about about good software engineering is even more important than even ever before with agentic coding.

- Clear acceptance criteria. Can you articulate exactly what and how you want to build.
  
- Deterministic validation. a.k.a tests. How can you prove the new code does what its supposed to do. Did it break something else? 

- Documentation. specifically in markdown. Your codebase architecture, patterns, do, dont's, everything needs to be written down, concisely.

- Seperation of concerns.  Context windows are getting bigger yes, but if you split your code at the right edges, LLMs can reason better with a more constrained context which is only going to help.
