 On the 2nd April 2023 I made it to Everest Basecamp. It was probably one of the most physically demanding things I have ever done. I endured altitude sickness, sleep depravation, freezing temperatures and I don't regret any part of it.

Lots of people have made it to basecamp before, but this is how it went for me.  

## Day 1 - Arrival at Lukkla (1800m)

We onboarded a tiny and shaky plane from Kathmundu a flew for about an hour to arrive at Lukkla. 

Stepping off the plane we witnessed the towering mountains all around us. The scale of these mountains surrounding you is hard a feeling to explain, but in a word, _humbling_.

The team and I had to wait for a little bit for our luggage before we could begin. The plane was not big enough to store everybody's backpacks so they were coming in the next plane in.

We passed the time by having by having some hot chocolates and once our luggage finally arrived we promptly started our first leg of the hike. 

Our first 8km hike took us from Lukkla to Phakding.  We crossed our first couple of suspension bridges and already felt very high in the mountains. 

We arrived at our first teahouse, the Sherpa Guide Lodge, where we would spend one night.

## Day 2 - Hike to Namche Bazaar (3200m)

Our Sherpas at the time didn't tell us, but this would be one of the hardest treks of the trip.  

Blissfully unware, today we would ascend over 1000m. The route started easy and the weather was perfect for hiking. We enjoyed the stunning mountainous scenery around us as we continued to follow the beaten trail that followed the Kosi River upstream. We eventually reached the entry of the Sargamatha National Park entry. The home of Mount Everest!

The second half the hike we had to push through a trail that turned suddenly steep and treacherous in places but the reward was arriving at the largest settlement along the course, Namche Bazaar. Here we would spend two days acclimatising to the new altitude at 3200m.

## Day 3 - Namche Acclimatisation

A slightly more relaxed day after yesterday big hike. We got up early to see stunning for a gentle walk near our tea house  to be greeted to  a stunning sunrance and we got our first glimpse of Mount Everest!

The second half of the day we had a short trek to a tiny settlement and had lesson about how to use oxygen masks (we did'nt need them!).  After our open air lecture we trekked back to our teahouse and had the rest of the afternoon off to explore the center of  Namche where cafes and interesting shops were a plenty.

## Day 4 - Namche Acclimatisation part 2

Over night snow fell. It's amazing how the scenary changes so dramatically. The team and I were giddy all giddy as if christmas had come early.

For our second acclimatisation day we  explored the areas in the vicinity of Namche Bazar some more. We went for a  light trek  to the nearby settlements of Khunde and Khumjung where we had the opportunity to visit the local hospital and school. It gave us a real sense of what living in the mountains is like.

## Day 5 - Tengboche (3700m)

It was time to move on from Namche. It would be a fairly long hike to our next location, Tengboche. Before arriving we had the opportunity to visit what must be one of the highest situated monastery's in the world. Here we have the opportunity to visit monks whilst they were praying and chanting with instruments. A truly amazing thing to witness.

## Day 6 - Dingbouche (4400m)

We were on the move again and it would be another long hike moving on from Tengbouche to the settlement of Dingbouche where the environments started to get much harsher. We would reach an altitude of over 4400m . At this elevation it was noticeably more barren and cold. The lack of greenery around me got to me a little bit. Things were starting to get tough for me at this stage.

Funnily, at this location resided one of the most endearing little cafes I have ever been to. They were serving high quality coffees in a cosy environment  and there was even a tiny little cinema! We settled down here for the evening to watch the documentary  [Sherpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa_(film)). As the evening drew, the wind and snow had started to pick up so we had to run back to our accommodation through what felt like a little white out. The teahouse was noticiabally cold  so to keep warm we all had to huddle around a burner fuels by Yak manure! (yes really). It didn't smell as bad as you might imagined.

## Day 7 - Dingbouche Acclimatisation

We spent one day at Dingbouche to acclimatise to this altitude and it was well needed. Most of the team were quite tired at this stage so we just had a gentle hike around the local area. 

Afterwards out sherpas gave us demo for a life-saving contraption known as a portable altitude chamber (PAC). This is used to treat high altitude illness such as AMS, HAPE and HACE by increasing the pressure in the chamber using a foot pump.

 We spent the the rest of the day resting up back at the cafe. Tomorrow would be a big day.

## Day 8 - Tengboche

We had to move on from Dingbouche and hike to Tengboche today. Snow had fallen again but the team was noticeably quieter in the morning. Altitude sickness had hit most of us including myself. The recommendation to knock back a couple of paracetamols for the headache was no longer helping out much. Nonetheless we booted up and begun an icy trek!

## Day 9 - 

Today was the day! We were going to reach Everest basecamp today. We had to reach our  teahouse Gorak Shek by lunch to have small break and do one last push which would take us to Everest basecamp and then hike _back_ to Gorak Shep.

Though it wasnt without drama. Before starting the day  one team member   took a tough decision to drop out due to  overwheling altitude sickness....

Half to Gorak Shep we also lost another member, we had to call for an emergancy horse to bring her down the mountain.  It was just 4 out of the orignal team members left now. 

As planned, we reach Gorak Shep by lunch, exhausted. I was not feeling good at this stage either, I thought I may need to drop out next too. But somehow, I gritted my teeth and pushed through the final leg, getting slightly delirous at this stage. 

We made it to Everest basecamp!

It was slighlty surreal.

Our Sherpa gave us a kit kat to celebrate.

We took pictures by the famous basecamp rock.

And suddenly as we arrived, it was time to head back to Gorak Shek.

We had accomplished what we set out to do. I couldn't quite believe it and I'm not sure if it has truly quite sunk in.

## Day 10 -

We were all tired, but we were ready to leave.  It was a surpringly long hike, but at least it was mostly downhill. It was probably the longest hike we did all trip. a whoping 18km hike down all the way past Dingboche and back in one of the teahouses we stayed in at Pangbouche. 

Here we reunited with the other two members that didn't make it to EBC. Even though it  was only 1 day. It felt like a massive reunion. The band was back together and it was an amazing feeling.

## Day 11 -

We all felt mostly rejuventated today and ready to descend more, it was interesting revisiting sites on the way back down. We were all still pretty tired, but in high spirits.

## Day 12 -

The descent took us back to Namche and we were all excited. It felt like we were back at the captial city. There was trees and greenary again and our altitude sickness was mostly gone. 

We felt like regulars walking around Namche this time round. The feeling was different, less aprehension of the what was to come. We could properly relax this time round.

## Day 13 -

  The penultimate day of the hike took us back to the very teahouse we stayed in and argubaly the best one. Hot showers, _much_ higher quality food and we all celebrated with a beer. Sweet, sweet beer.

## Day 14 -

The last leg of the descent and we were back to were it all began, Lukla. We stayed one night here, enjoyed the local cafes and also PIZZA! In the morning we board yet another rickity plane back to Katmundhu.

We had done it!

## The whole route

  

Of course I _had_ to make my own visualisation with all this GPS data. So heres my own interactive map the entire route broken down into the daily legs.
