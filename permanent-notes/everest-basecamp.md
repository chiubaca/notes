On the 11th October 2022 I signed up for an opportunity to hike Everest Basecamp for [work](https://neverbland.com/blog/neverbland-dev-team-sign-up-for-everest-basecamp) . On the 2nd April 2023 I made it to Everest Basecamp. It was probably one of the most physically demanding things I have ever done. I endured altitude sickness, sleep depravation, freezing temperatures and I don't regret any part of it.

Lots of people have made it to basecamp before me but this is how it went for me.  

## Day 1 - Arrival at Lukkla (1800m)



The team and I arrive at Lukkla on tiny and shaky plane and hiked our first 8k to a tiny teahouse in Phakding.

## Day 2 - Hike to Namche Bazaar

Our Sherpas at the time didn't tell us. But this would be one of the hardest treks of the trip.  Blissfully unware we would ascend over 1000m today. The route was steep and treacherous in places. In hindsight it was genius move by our Sherpas to not let us know how tough this route would be.

The reward was arriving at the largest settlement along the course. Namche Bazaar. Here we would spend two day acclimatising to the altitude

## Day 3 -

A slightly more relaxed day after yesterday big hike. We got up early for a gentle walk near our tea house to get our first glimpse of Mount Everest! Then we had the rest of the day to explore the Bazar where we enjoyed local coffee with amazing scenery of mountains all around us.

## Day 4 -

We spent another full day  in the vicinity of Namche Bazar but the Sherpas took us for  light trek  to the nearby settlements of Khunde and Khumjung where we had the opportunity to visit the local hospital and school. It gave us a real sense of what living in the mountains is like.

## Day 5 -

We moved on from Namche Bazzar for a long hike to our next location, Tengboche. Before arriving we had the opportunity to visit what must be one of highest situated monastery in the world. Here we have the opportunity to visit monks whilst they were praying and chanting with instruments. A truly amazing thing to witness.

## Day 6 -

Another long hike moving on from Tengbouche to the settlement of Dingbouche where the environments started to get much harsher. We reached altitude of 4000m . At this elevation it was noticeably more barren and cold. The lack of greenery around me got to me a little bit. Things were starting to get tough for me at this stage. 

Funnily, at this location resided one of the most endearing little cafes I have ever been  to. They were serving high quality coffees in a cosy environment with tiny little cinema. We settled down here for the evening to watch the documentary  [Sherpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa_(film)). As the evening drew, we had to run back to our accommodation through windy and dark evening, the snow was picking up it got a lot colder so we had to huddle around a burner fuels by Yak manure! (yes really). It didn't smell as bad as you might imagined.

## Day 7 -

We spent one day at Dingbouche to acclimatise to this altitude and it was well needed. Most of the team were quite tired at this stage. We just hand gentle hike around the local area and we spent the the rest of the day resting up back at the cafe. Tomorrow would be a big day.

## Day 8 -

  We moved on from Dingbouche to hike to Tengboche. The team were noticeably quieter during this leg of the walk. Altitude sickness had hit most of us including myself. The recommendation to knock down a couple of paracetamols for the headache was no longer helping out much. Nonetheless, we trekked on.

## Day 9 - 

Today was the day! We were going reach Everest basecamp today. We had to reach our  teahouse Gorak Shek by lunch to have small break and do one last push which would take us to Everest basecamp and then hike _back_ to Gorak Shep.

Though it wasnt without drama. Before starting the day  one team member   took a tough decision to drop out due to  overwheling altitude sickness....

Half to Gorak Shep we also lost another member, we had to call for an emergancy horse to bring her down the mountain.  It was just 4 out of the orignal team members left now. 

As planned, we reach Gorak Shep by lunch, exhausted. I was not feeling good at this stage either, I thought i may need to drop out next too. But for somehow, i gritted my teeth and pushed through the final leg, getting slightly delirous at this stage. We made it to Everest basecamp!

It was slighlty surreal.

Our Sherpa gave us a kit kat to celebrate.

We took pictures by the famous basecamp rock.

And as suddenly as we arrived, it was time to head back to Gorak Shek.

We had accomplished what we set out to do. I couldn't quite believe and I'm not sure if it as every quite truly sunk in.

## Day 10 -

We were all tired, but we were ready to leave.   It was a surpringly long hike, but at least it was mostly downhill. It was probably the longest hike we did all trip. a whoping 18km hike down all the way past Dingboche and back in one of the teahouses we stayed in at Pangbouche. 

Here we reunited with the other two members that did'nt make it to EBC. Even though it  was only 1 day. It felt like a massive reunion. The band was back together and it was amazing feeling.

## Day 11 -

We all felt mostly rejuventated today and ready to descend more, it was interesting revisiting sites on the way back down. We all still pretty tired, but in high sprits

## Day 12 -

The descent took us back to Namche and we were all excited. It felt like we were back at the captial city. There was trees and greenary again and our altitude sickness was mostly gone. 

We felt like regulars walking around Namche this time round. The feeling was different, less aprehension of the what was to come. We could properly relax this time round.

## Day 13 -

  The penultimate day of the hike took us back to the very teahouse we stayed in and argubaly the best one . Hot showers, _much_ higher quality food and we all celebrated with a beer. Sweet, sweet beer.

## Day 14 -

The last leg of the descent and we were back to were it all began. Lukla. We stayed one night here, enjoyed the local cafes and also PIZZA! In the morning we board yet another rickity plane back to Katmundhu.

We had done it!

## The whole route

  

Of course I _had_ to make my own visualisation with all this GPS data. So heres my own interactive map the entire route broken down into the daily legs.
