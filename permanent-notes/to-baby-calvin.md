Hey Calvin, it's Chinese New Year today. You've been part of our new family for 1 month and 3 days today. It's been a beautiful January having you here. You're small, but so mighty. You kick hard I need to take you MMA lessons when you're older I can tell you're going to be physically strong.

You're so precious when I hold you in my arms. I can't but help think about your future when I look into your big eyes. Who will you be, what will you do? If you ever feel lost I hope these words help you. 

Your family are the most important people to you in the whole world.

Don't be shy, make friends. They will be your wall to lean on.

Explore and experience everything you can, this life is short.

Go deep on anything that peaks your interest.

Your Mum and Dad love you so much.

Choose happiness.
