We're using NX more at work; I initially didnt really _get it_ . I had the following pre-conceptions of nx before taking a deeper dive into it

- nx is only mean for really big teams 
- nx is only for complicated codebases
- nx shouldnt be used for smaller projects


I've come out the other end of my learnings to find all of the preconceptions to be false
