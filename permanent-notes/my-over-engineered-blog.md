New year, new blog.

Therefore, of course I need to rebuild by blog from scratch! 

And thus we inevitably have the meta blog post about how I built my blog, posted on my blog.  It's tale as old as time and I'm painfully self aware what this looks like when I start writing about how I built my awesome blog, again.

I'll be the first to admit at this stage, I am the midwit meme personified. And you know what? 

I love it. 

It spent _way_ more time than I'm willing to admit putting blogging setup together. But it's always a fun learning experience. If you're developer you should also over-engineer your blog. More on that later.

I wont take a deep dive into how everything works, you can do that yourself by looking at the [source code](https://github.com/chiubaca/chiubaca-monorepo) . What I'll do is briefly explain all the components.

For writing my notes in markdown. 

 I'm loosely using the [[zettelkasten](https://notes.chiubaca.com/permanent-notes/zettelkasten)](https://notes.chiubaca.com/permanent-notes/zettelkasten/)method. The idea is that If i can link together enough fleeting and literature notes. They will become a permanent note.




I currently maintain two sites 

- https://notes.chiubaca.com - my public notes for literally anything. tecn
