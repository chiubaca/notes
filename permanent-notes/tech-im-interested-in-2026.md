I think i'm going to make this a yearly thing. firstly a quick retrospective on my [tech-im-interested-in-2025](permanent-notes/tech-im-interested-in-2025.md) blog. How did I do?


❌ AT Protocol - I started but didn't get very far. I'm still interested in the building the ATProto Strava.

❌ MCP - I used _some_ MCP servers, but not really integrated them into my workflow much. I wanted to build my _own_ MCP but just got round to reading some Anthooipic docs and that was it.

✅ React 19 - I wrote about a bunch of new react 19 stuff [underused-react-features](permanent-notes/underused-react-features.md) and did my first tech talk at a meetup about it! Really proud of my [slides](https://react-advanced-lightning-talk.chiubaca.com/) on this.

✅ Home Assistant - Ok i'm giving myself the tick for this, even though I never got around to installing Home assistant. I did a bunch of home lab stuff. Learnt about Jellyfin and got my home [media-server](permanent-notes/media-server.md) running and automated. Its been a fun project and got really far with it thanks to using AI in Warp.

✅ Full stack Cloudflare - worked through all of [full stack on cloudflare](https://learn.backpine.com/) course and learn loads. Been tinkering around with web-sockets in Durable Objects, workflows , AI and some browser automation stuff. Currently tinkering on https://chonk-poker.chiubaca.com/ which is all Cloudflare. Loving the stack right now

## 2026

## MCP

On the list again. Its getting too big to ignore. I will make at least one MCP this year and try to incorporate them more into my Dev and AI workflows.

## Cloudflare AI workers

A lot of cool models right in the Cloudflare ecosystem and they're making it very easy to consume and use. I want to tinker with some of these models and try to build a product around them.

## AI Tools

Gonna try and incorporate Claude code and OpenCode and  general agents stuff  more in my coding workflows more. I'm very time poor these days, these tools let me iterate quickly! I can build things whilst i sleep technically. Time to capitalise on these technologies.

## 3D

i've been intimidated by 3D for long time, though I've dabbled with Three.js a tad, I know there is still so much to learn. I'm also using 3D as an overarching area that involves XR and game dev. First it would be good to get comfortable with working with Three.js , Three.js Fibre, Babylon.js and the likes. As with everything, just build something.

## Tanstack 

I've already been tinkering around with Tanstack Start, Query and Form a bit and the whole toolchain is airtight, but still so much to learn. Will continue to use these libs for future projects.
