I think i'm going to make this a yearly thing. firstly a quick retrospective on my [tech-im-interested-in-2025](permanent-notes/tech-im-interested-in-2025.md) blog. How did I do?


❌ AT Protocol - I started but didn't get very far. I'm still interested in the building the ATProto Strava.

❌ MCP - I used _some_ MCP servers, but not really integrated them into my workflow much. I wanted to build my _own_ MCP but just got round to reading some Anthooipic docs and that was it.

✅ React 19 - I wrote about a bunch of new react 19 stuff [underused-react-features](permanent-notes/underused-react-features.md) and did my first tech talk at a meetup about it! Really proud of my [slides](https://react-advanced-lightning-talk.chiubaca.com/) on this.

✅ Home Assistant - Ok i'm giving myself the tick for this, even though I never got around to installing Home assistant. I did a bunch of home lab stuff. Learnt about Jellyfin and got my home [media-server](permanent-notes/media-server.md) running and automated. Its been a fun project and got really far with it thanks to using AI in Warp.

✅ Full stack Cloudflare - worked through all of [full stack on cloudflare](https://learn.backpine.com/) course and learn loads. Been tinkering around with web-sockets in Durable Objects, workflows , AI and some browser automation stuff. Currently tinkering on https://chonk-poker.chiubaca.com/ which is all Cloudflare. Loving the stack right now
