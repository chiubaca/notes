 On the 2nd April 2023 I made it to Everest Basecamp. It was probably one of the most physically demanding things I have ever done. I endured altitude sickness, sleep depravation, freezing temperatures and it was one the most amazing things I've ever done.

Lots of people have made it to basecamp before, but this is how it went for me.  

## Day 1 - Arrival at Lukkla (1800m)

We onboarded a tiny and shaky plane from Kathmundu a flew for about an hour to arrive at Lukkla. 

Stepping off the plane we witnessed the towering mountains all around us. I have no other word to describe the scale of these mountains but, _humbling_.

The team and I had to wait for a little bit for our luggage before we could begin. The plane was not big enough to store everybody's backpacks so they were coming in the next plane in.

We passed the time by having by having some hot chocolates and once our luggage finally arrived we promptly started our first leg of the hike. 

Our first 8km hike took us from Lukkla to Phakding.  We crossed our first couple of suspension bridges and already felt very high in the mountains. 

We arrived at our first teahouse, the Sherpa Guide Lodge, where we would spend one night.

## Day 2 - Hike to Namche Bazaar (3200m)

Our Sherpas at the time didn't tell us, but this would be one of the hardest treks of the trip.  

Blissfully unware, today we would ascend over 1000m. The route started easy and the weather was perfect for hiking. We enjoyed the stunning mountainous scenery around us as we continued to follow the beaten trail that followed the Kosi River upstream. We eventually reached the entry of the Sargamatha National Park entry. The home of Mount Everest!

The second half the hike we had to push through a trail that turned suddenly steep and treacherous in places but the reward was arriving at the largest settlement along the course, Namche Bazaar. Here we would spend two days acclimatising to the new altitude at 3200m.

## Day 3 - Namche Acclimatisation

A slightly more relaxed day after yesterday big hike. We got up early to see stunning for a gentle walk near our tea house  to be greeted to  a stunning sunrance and we got our first glimpse of Mount Everest!

The second half of the day we had a short trek to a tiny settlement and had lesson about how to use oxygen masks (we did'nt need them!).  After our open air lecture we trekked back to our teahouse and had the rest of the afternoon off to explore the center of  Namche where cafes and interesting shops were a plenty.

## Day 4 - Namche Acclimatisation part 2

Over night snow fell. It's amazing how the scenery changes so dramatically after a dusting of snow. Over breakfast the team and I were giddy as if christmas had come early.

For our second acclimatisation day we  explored the areas in the vicinity of Namche Bazar some more. We went for a  light trek  to the nearby settlements of Khunde and Khumjung where we had the opportunity to visit the local hospital and school. It gave us a real sense of what living in the mountains is like.

## Day 5 - Tengboche (3700m)

It was time to move on from Namche. It would be a fairly long hike to our next location, Tengboche. Before arriving we had the opportunity to visit what must be one of the highest situated monastery's in the world. Here we had the opportunity to visit monks whilst they were praying and chanting with instruments. A truly amazing thing to witness.

## Day 6 - Dingbouche (4400m)

We were on the move again and it would be another long hike moving on from Tengbouche to the settlement of Dingbouche where the environment started to get much harsher. We would reach an altitude of over 4400m . At this elevation it was noticeably barren and cold now. The lack of greenery around me got to me a little bit and physically things were starting to get tough for me at this stage.

The route would take us through a cemetry of climbers and sherpas whos fate had been taken from climbing mount everest. We had moment of reflection to think about all the hikers and sherpas that come before us here. It was customary to place a stone on the mounds that were building up.

When we reached Tengbouche, we were  surprised to find an endearing little cafe called Cafe 44000. They were serving high quality coffees in a cosy environment  and there was even a tiny little cinema! We has the chance to relax here for an hour, but as the evening drew in, the wind and snow had started to pick up so we had to run back to our accommodation through what felt like a little white out. The teahouse was noticiabally cold  so to keep warm we all had to huddle around a burner fuels by Yak manure! (yes really). It didn't smell as bad as you might imagined.

## Day 7 - Dingbouche Acclimatisation

We spent one day at Dingbouche to acclimatise to this altitude and it was well needed. Most of the team were quite tired at this stage so we just had a gentle hike around the local area. 

Afterwards out sherpas gave us demo for a life-saving contraption known as a portable altitude chamber (PAC). This is used to treat high altitude illness such as AMS, HAPE and HACE by increasing the pressure in the chamber using a foot pump.

 We spent the the rest of the day resting up back at the cafe and we watched the documentary [Sherpa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa_(film)). The down time felt well earned as tomorrow would be a big day.

## Day 8 - Loboche (4900m)

We headed to Loboche today. Snow had fallen again but the team was noticeably quieter in the morning. Altitude sickness had hit most of us including myself. The recommendation to knock back a couple of paracetamols for the headache was no longer helping out much. Nonetheless we booted up and begun an icy trek!

The trek was a combination of beaming hot sun to bitterly cold cross winds, but one thing that was a constant was the stunning white mountains surrounding us. 

We reached our teahouse before dusk. It was noticablably busier than all the other places we stayed at. It made sense as there was less accomodation options to stay the higher you get. At this altitude, this teahouse would be the penultimate location for many before reaching base camp. 

The altitude sickness for me had been lingering throughout the whole day, grating away at my energy levels. So tried to get an early night and make my self comfortable. however at this this altitude taking your clothes off to wipe down is _very_ difficult.  You just want to stay in your clothes and not move. At this stage I had mastered the dance of stripping down and jumping into my sleeping bag as quick as possible.  Tomorrow was the day.

## Day 9 - Final push to Everest Basecamp (5300m)

I slept horribly. The small part of my face that was exposed in my sleeping bag was so dry and chapped. My headache was somehow even worse and felt like I had hit my head against a wall

Somehow, we were going hike to Everest basecamp today.

Over breakfast, it turned it was not just me who had night sleep one  member of the team had struggled to catch their breath over nighht  and took a tough decision to drop out and make their way down to help recover. we were all devasted.

We had to push on though. The plan was to reach another tea house at Gorak Shep by noon, have small break then do the final push to Everest basecamp. Half way enroute to Gorak Shep another team member had to pull out, the altitude sickness was too overwhelming.  It was just 4 out of the orignal team  6  team members left now. 

As planned, we reached Gorak Shep by noon, exhausted. I was not feeling good at this stage either, I thought I may need to drop out next too. But somehow, I gritted my teeth and pushed through the final leg, getting slightly delirous at this stage. 

Step by step, we eventually made it. I was standing at Everest basecamp!

It felt surreal. Different emotions came flooding through. Relief , excitement and happiness I was also sad that our other team members were not here.

And as quickly suddenly as we arrived, it was time to head back to Gorak Shek.

We had accomplished what we set out to do. I couldn't quite believe it and I'm _still_ not sure if it has truly quite sunk in.

## Day 10 - Descend to Pangboche (3900m)

Naturally we were all tired from yesterday, but we ready to leave.  However, we unexpectedly  did our longest hike today but it was mostly downhill. We would descend a whoping 18km  taking past Loboche and Dingboche.

>Taking a break during the descent

We reunited with the other two members that didn't make it to EBC at a tea house at Pangbouche. Even though  were only apart for one day It felt like a big reunion. It was like the band was back together and it was an amazing feeling. Descending down over 1000m made all of us feel _much_ better from the altitude sickness. Spirits were high over dinner as we shared our stories of what happened.

## Day 11 / 12- Back to Namche (3400m)

it was interesting revisiting sites on the way back down and very meter we descend we felt more rejuventated and stronger.  It would take us two day to reach Namche again and it we were all excited. It felt like we were back at the captial city.

We felt like regulars walking around Namche this time round. The feeling was different, less apprehension of the what was to come. We could properly relax this time round.

## Day 13 - Back at Phakding (2600m)

The penultimate day of the hike, we excited Sagarmatha national park and arrived back at the very first teahouse we stayed in and arguably the best one, the Sherpa Guide Lodge. Hot showers, _much_ higher quality food and we all celebrated with a beer. Sweet, sweet beer.

## Day 14 -

The last leg of the descent and we were back to were it all began, Lukkla. We stayed one night here, enjoyed the local cafes and also PIZZA! 

Over dinner, the sherpas that had guided us throughout the trip gave us a little ceremony to celebrate what we had accomplished over the last 14 days. We had our chance to thank our sherpas and we reflected what amazing trip this had been.

We had done it!

## The whole route


Of course I _had_ to make my own visualisation with all this GPS data. So heres my own interactive map the entire route broken down into the daily legs.
