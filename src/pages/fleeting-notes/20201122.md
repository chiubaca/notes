- Decided build a front-end for my learning micro journal with 11ty. Struggled a little with the basics of 11ty perhaps i dived too deep into templating a bit too early. either way managed to cobble together something. Also wired up github action to rebuild the site upon new journal entries. Automating all the things!
- Read more Essentialsm. The last few sections literally quoted "Do more with less". Can't help but feel like I've read these tips before. Cut waste from your life, dont do spend energy on doing things which dont push your goals and priorites forward.
