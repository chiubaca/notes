- Made start of some more advanced topics of PostgreQL and started to learn about [plpgsql (Postgres' extension of SQL to make it much more advanced language)](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-plpgsql/). Made a simple calculator function.
- Went on to install the plv8 postgresql extension and rewrote the calc in JavaScript, within PostgreSQL. ðŸ¤¯. Then spotted that there is now also a way to run [WASM binaries in postgres too](https://github.com/kiwicopple/wasmer-postgres). PostgreSQL land is wild!
- Read a few pages of Deep Work. Emails are the bane of deep work. It cost companies literally millions of pounds of wasted productivity.
