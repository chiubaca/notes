- some wins with Prisma 2 today. The API is finally starting to make sense. Intuitively reached for a [`count`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/aggregation-grouping-summarizing#count) and it was there! . Also the `schema.prisma` file makes a lot of sense when you have lots pre written tables written already. You can see how different relationships are created.
