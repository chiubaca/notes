- Refactored a bunch of m4m code to use styled components. I still have mixed feelings arouns css-in-js
  - conditional logic inside styled components feels overly complex
  - I dont like this syntax `${props => { props.thing // do stuff with props.thing }}`
  - moving styled components out of the same `.tsx` files helps cleanup big files but feels like it removes the benefit of single file `.tsx` files.
