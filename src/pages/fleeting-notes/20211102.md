- Thinking about [design systems](https://www.tallan.com/insights/what-is-a-design-system/)...

> Design systems help maintain, govern and preserve brand standards. Colors, typography, horizontal & vertical spacing and rhythm, as well as numerous other design aspects that can be mutated over time through various iterations of design. If design aspects are changed consistently, there is a possibility of causing negative impact to a brandâ€™s image, website or application and can appear disheveled. Additionally, the brand can lose credibility with these types of inconsistencies. 

- > Tier 1: Typography & color styles, spacing rules
- > Tier 2: Atom level components using styling from Tier 1 which may include buttons, dropdowns and input fields
- > Tier 3: Combining elements of tier 2 components to create more complex patterns.
