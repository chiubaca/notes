- Learnt about the difference between defining your graphql schemas using a code-first vs a SDL (schema-first) approach. I learnt the SDL approach first during Fullstack TS, React & Node. The run down of the industry learnings are well documented in this [blog by prisma](https://www.prisma.io/blog/the-problems-of-schema-first-graphql-development-x1mn4cb0tyl3). It seems the industry initially agreed that an SDL approach first is good, but has now pivoted to code-first methodology. This is becasue you only need to reason with the implementation of your GQL resolvers in one language. Nexus is an example of code first GQL library.
