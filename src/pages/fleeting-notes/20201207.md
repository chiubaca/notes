- Finished `Section 14. PostgreSQL Data Types in Depth` on https://www.postgresqltutorial.com. Great module on Array type and also Hstore and JSON data management all in SQL. Got me excited how useful these data types will be for web apps like Jottivity. Also learnt about custom domans and types for which are useful for executing common queries as database functions. Mind blown. I feel silly after many years of working with RDBMS at a very shallow level I am only now fully realising the full capabilities of something like postgres!
