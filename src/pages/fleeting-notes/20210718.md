- re- reading [Good Bye Clean Code](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/). Abstraction comes at a cost.

  > My code traded the ability to change requirements for reduced duplication, and it was not a good trade

- the article also touches upon apathy for your fellow developers whom you work with. how would you like it if someone smashed down your lego empire to rebuild it _their_ way
  > I didn't talk to the person who wrote it. I rewrote the code and checked it in without their input. Even if it was an improvement (which I don't believe anymore), this is a terrible way to go about it. A healthy engineering team is constantly building trust. Rewriting your teammate's code without a discussion is a huge blow to your ability to effectively collaborate on a codebase together.
