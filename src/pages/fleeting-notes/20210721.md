- When in React, [composition > inheritence](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)

> Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a componentâ€™s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way. Remember that components may accept arbitrary props, including primitive values, React elements, or functions.

> If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, we suggest extracting it into a separate JavaScript module. The components may import it and use that function, object, or a class, without extending it.
