- Crash course on using Redis for managing session state in an app and also TypeORM for managing db schemas in PostgreSQL. Suddenly a lot of new technologies to get my head around. A few things I'm pondering.... how much of redis can be offload to browsers localstorage instead for state? This textbook has a big emphasis on server side state management, which they claim provides you more control over the users environment. What kind of apps _need_ that level of control?

- First time dabling with an ORM and i've always understood their purpose and can definitly see their benifits. Like with any abstractions, it's always good to learn the the lower level technology when possible. ORMs make me slightly uncomfortable as I'm giving up the how the SQL is being written. I think these abstractions only make sense when you have multiple developers and there needs to be some sort of conformality ...
  > does the level of complexity introduced to app grow accordingly to number of developers that are working on it? As more tools are created to seemingly makes our lives easier, they eventully become industry standards which everyone else has to understand. There is something to be said about solo devs like peiter levels who can build apps extremely quickly using very simple technologies... #rambling
