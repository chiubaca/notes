- Still making my through ["Intro to Apollo Client 3.0"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou0fEW1eRjc)

  - Use the `fields` property in the apollo cache `typePolices` to create computed fields which are dynamically created per API request. e.g you could combile a first and last name together like this.
  - When fetching multiples "things" via graphql, make sure everything is denormalised in the cache. to do this just ensure that there is a unique identifier via an `id` or u have specified it via the `keyFields` type policy. This important becasue, if you wanted to query just a singular of the "Things". Apollo would still make a network request, even though it already has the information in the cache. To let apollo know that the data may already be in the cache we have to specify `read` rules for a the query in the `InMemoryCache`. Make use of the `toReference` callback function, which requires u to provide the `__typeName` and the unique identifier configured for that resolver. see [`1h40`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou0fEW1eRjc&t=4707s).
  - delete specific parts of the cache with the `evit()` method.

- Nullish coalescing operator `??` is handy. It's similar to tge logical OR operator `||`, but it also determines `0` or `''`(empty string) as falsey.
