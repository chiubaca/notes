- Worked through https://www.robincussol.com/docker-for-js-devs-how-to-containerise-nodejs-apps-efficiently/. Nice tutorial on how to productionise an Next.js app (should apply fue vue apps) efficiently by doing the following :

  - have a comprehensive .dockerignore file
  - use an appropriate base image
  - decouple the dependency installation step to improve caching
  - decouple the resulting built application from the build step
  - purge the node_modules from unnecessary files

- Worked through [Tutorial: Node.js live debugging ](https://training.play-with-docker.com/nodejs-live-debugging/)
- Read a few more pages of Essentialism. Focus on little wins and system than encourages progress. Pretty much what I am working on with this micro blog. Every small completed activity is a win and should be logged.
