  - dont "own" your parts of the codebase, you should be able to work on any part of the stack
  - dont be afraid to break things . If you are, why? You probably needs more resilient tests in place
  - dont focus on the happy path, think of every way your app can break
  - dont think it's someone elses problem. You have the power to change things
