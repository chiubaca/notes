- Been reading up about MFA for work. This resource is excellent [https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Multifactor_Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#implementing-mfa](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Multifactor_Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#implementing-mfa)
- Acronyms
  - MFA - Multi Factor Authentication
  - 2FA - Two Factor Authentication
  - TOTP - Time-based One Time Password (not Top-Of-The-Pops!)
  - OTP - One Time Password
- Nice tutorials on how to implement with node
