- Read up to chapter 29.1 of coding career
- Finally the got css working the way i wanted on the film recommendation app. I had forgotten all the nuances with absoulte and relative positioning. So basically I wanted to absolute position some text inside children divs which were part of flexbox. I had to ensure there was relative positioning set to the container of the child flex item item otherwise the absolute positioning would be absolute relative to the window and not it's parent container. SO CONFUSING. Also made progress with vue 3 code and get the state of selected movies working correctl	y.
