- Xmas eve today! Starting to rebuild my personal blog site using Nuxt and the content module. Though 11ty looks great and barebones . I want to code my own blog with minimal effort and have a good DX.
- Troubleshooting some errors with supabase vue slack clone too. Want to draw a liner under it soon. I've got a much better grasp of how to build realtime apps with supabase now.
