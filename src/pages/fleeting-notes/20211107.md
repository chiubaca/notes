- Good video on [a11y and html](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NexL5_Vdoq8) 
   - only use one `h1` on a page
   - think of using `h` tags to structure the order of your page like a text book. but not in regards to styling
   - `h` tags should work downwards sequentially
   - it's ok to use multiple `header` and `nav` tags
   - sematic html creates landmarks that make it easier to skip over section for screen readers.
