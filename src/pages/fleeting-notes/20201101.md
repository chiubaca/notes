- Read a lot of Typescript deep dive. read the whole chapter about the TS type system. There were a few things i didnt understand, like callables and moving types went over my head a bit. lots of it was reviewing the things i learnt in execute compute.
- Read a few more pages of the one thing, Some sentence completion exercises I need to try to help figure out what the one thing is for my personal life , family, work, job community. Not sure if i fully buy into the sentence completion mind tricks but i remember it was a big deal the "six pillars of self esteem"
