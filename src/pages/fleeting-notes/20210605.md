- Spent a long time working on m4m landing page. React and Styled component really shining through as mental model to abstract different parts of the UI into intuitive components. For example I had 3 sections which were handling the backgrounds. Instead I was able to abstract all background markup into a single wrapper component, then all section content would be wrapped by this. So much cleaner! Doing this with vanilla html I could imagine the markup to get very unweildy.
