- Revised mocking, spies and unit testing with Jest today. Revisiting fundamental testing concepts via some great blogs by Kent C Dodds:

  - [But really, what is a JavaScript test?](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/but-really-what-is-a-javascript-test)
  - [But really, what is a JavaScript mock?](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/but-really-what-is-a-javascript-mock)

- `jest.fn()`, lets you mock the implementation of method that might be expensive or flakey to run. Usually you write a mock implementation to return some fake data like `jest.fn((x)=> x)` a.k.a `jest.fn(<any arbitary function>)`

- Kent D Dodds talks about 'monkey patching' using `jest.fn()` which term which means to overide the exsiting functionality, which is useful when we need to mock a library. We can simply overide the implementation with our mock.

  ```js
  const originalGetWinner = utils.getWinner;
  utils.getWinner = jest.fn((p1, p2) => p2);
  ```

  - When using plain JS, `utils.getWinner` gets new properties adding in by jest such as `.mock.instances`, `.mock.calls` and `mock.results` which are using for a range of different asserations like what arguments were passed in, where the original instance from and what the actual result was.
  - TS will complain that `mock` does not exist on the property, to get around this we can use a Jest spy instead. which a way to `watch` when the function/method was called. it looks like this:
  - ```js
    utils.getWinner = jest.fn((p1, p2) => p2);
    const spy = jest.spyOn(utils, "getWinner");

    const winner = thumbWar("alex", "jenny");
    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();

    spy.mock.calls.forEach((args) => {
      expect(args).toEqual(["alex", "jenny"]);
    });
    ```

    it offers all the same functionality that is exposed on a `.mock` property.
