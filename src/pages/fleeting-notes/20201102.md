- finished read TypeScript deep dive. Excellent text book and will be going back to as reference guide. the Tips section really got me thinking about about some using classes for Vue composition functions. need to try that out soon.
- finished the one thing. technically finished it on monday and did'nt realise! ok book. the sentence completion exercises is a nice way for the book to end and something to try out
- started reading clean code. Looks like it might be a long read. need to dedicate 30 min to it a day i think.
