- Lots of work in GQL land today. Finding some limitation with trying to write expressive rules for GQL to return a very specific data structure but not seeing a way how at the moment. I want to return an arrray with some very specific objects, no less, no more. Looking for a clean way to do this but hacking around the edges. Need to dive deeper in GQL syntax
