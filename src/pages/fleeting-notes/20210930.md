- in three.js land, `materials` are the abstractions over creating `shaders` to produce textures for 3D objects
- Reminder:  a `Three.Mesh` is comprised of a geometry and a material. The material is supplied as the second argument to the `Three.Mesh` constructor.

```js
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial();
const sphere = new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.5, 16, 16), material);
```

- Textures are simply image files that need to mapped (wrapped) around a 3D object

```js
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const doorColourTexture = textureLoader.load("/textures/door/color.jpg");
```

- Then we supply can provide this to the `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial` constructor.
```js
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
 map: doorColourTexture,
});
```

- There's a lot more params that can be provided to the `MeshBasicMaterial` options object. like `transparency` and `wireframe` see docs for reference

- Note, materials for `THREE.PlaneGeometry` only get rendered on one side.  this can be worked around with `material.side = THREE.DoubleSide;` . But means double the amount of triangles need to be calculated .

`THREE.MeshBasicMaterial` -  lets you map your own textures

`MeshNormalMaterial` -  displays a nice purple, blueish, greenish color

[`MeshMatcapMaterial`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshMatcapMaterial) picks colours relative the orientation of the camera, creating the illusion of a light source.(thus less resources required).

- amazing resource of matcaps here - https://github.com/nidorx/matcaps

[`MeshDepthMaterial`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshDepthMaterial) - displays  a hue of colour dependent on depth of the camera.
> You can use this material for special effects where you need to know how far the pixel is from the camera.


If we want to use something like the `THREE.MeshLambertMaterial` we need a real light source

```js

const pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 0.5)
pointLight.position.x = 2
pointLight.position.y = 3
pointLight.position.z = 4
scene.add(pointLight)
```


`MeshToonMaterial`- give a cool cel shaded look!

[`MeshStandardMaterial`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshStandardMaterial) uses physically based rendering principles. it supports lights but with a more realistic algorithm and better parameters like roughness and "metalness".

The `aoMap` property (literally "ambient occlusion map") will add shadows where the texture is dark. Useful for bring depth to textures.

To make this work we need to add another attribute to the geometry using `setAttribute` , which duplicates the existing `uv` attribute
```javascript
sphere.geometry.setAttribute('uv2', new THREE.BufferAttribute(sphere.geometry.attributes.uv.array, 2))
```

Now we can control the intensity of the `aoMap` like so:

```javascript
material.aoMap = doorAmbientOcclusionTexture
material.aoMapIntensity = 1
```

- displacing textures is cool way to bring depth to 3D object based on the texture. to so we provide a texture to the `displacementMap` property and then we can mess around with the `displacementScale`

```js
material.displacementMap = doorHeightTexture;

// crank up to exergate the texture
material.displacementScale = 0.1;
```

`envMap` or Environment maps can create nice mirror effect which map a surrounding texture into your mesh. 


```javascript
const cubeTextureLoader = new THREE.CubeTextureLoader()

const environmentMapTexture = cubeTextureLoader.load([
    '/textures/environmentMaps/0/px.jpg',
    '/textures/environmentMaps/0/nx.jpg',
    '/textures/environmentMaps/0/py.jpg',
    '/textures/environmentMaps/0/ny.jpg',
    '/textures/environmentMaps/0/pz.jpg',
    '/textures/environmentMaps/0/nz.jpg'
])
```
