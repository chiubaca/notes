- Been busy, but not sure if I've been productive lately. Lots of just-in-time learning but not been going deep on anything. Reminder that going deep on topic will open up new rabbit holes and unrevel new sources of inspo.

- Finally got round to finishing the particles lesson on three.js journey. Some things fundamentally don't understand.
    - `setAttribute` what are the attributes we're setting? what does this look like? can it be anything we want?
    - `Float32Array` - a kinda magical primitive to me. it's just an array of numbers right?

- Learning a lot about blending 3d objects together. The main takeaway is that three.js doesnt necessary know what should be on top of each other. This can be worked around with blending, and tinkering with `alphaMap`, `alphaTest`, `transparent` and `depthWrite` properties of your material.
