- Loading textures into Three.js is super easy

```js
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const texture = textureLoader.load(
  "http://192.168.1.106:8080/assets/images/c548d2d05b1ab054651d3e401b8e4ede.jpg"
);
```

- the texture can then be used inside the `MeshBasicMaterial` class.

```js
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texture });
```

- Note there are also three callback functions that can hookeded into:

```js
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const texture = textureLoader.load(
  "http://192.168.1.106:8080/assets/images/c548d2d05b1ab054651d3e401b8e4ede.jpg",
  () => {
    console.log("load");
  },
  () => {
    console.log("progress");
  },
  () => {
    console.log("error");
  }
);
```

Oftenly used to create loading bar is created by utalising the `THREE.LoadingManager` class. There are callback which can be accessed

```js
const loadingManager = new THREE.LoadingManager();
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader(loadingManager);

loadingManager.onStart = () => {
  console.log("Start");
};

loadingManager.onLoad = () => {
  console.log("Load");
};

loadingManager.onError = () => {
  console.log("Error");
};
```

- UV coordinates is the mechanism for specifying how textures get mapped onto a geometry. Premade geometries by Three.js have set UV coordinates which can be access via the `attributes` property on any Geometry classs. it will be a represented as a `Float32Array`

- Textures can be remapped at runtime by tweaking the propertie on the texture object.

  - `repeat.x/y` - repeat a texture x amount of time on the x or y axis
  - `offeset.x/y` - offset a textureon either the x or y axis
  - `offeset.wrapS` - this is needs to be set with `Three.MirrorRepeatWrapping`
  - `offeset.wrapT` - this is needs to be set with `Three.MirrorRepeatWrapping`
  - `rotation`
  - `rotation.center` - changes to pivot point when rotating

- Image filtering can change the appearence of texture to make them more or less sharp

  - `minFilter` has better performance but will stretch and blur your textures
  - `magFilter` will make your image looks sharp and remove any blurryness
  - Both needs to be set with `Three.NearestFilter`

- texture resolutions must be by a power of two otherwise performance will suffer

- jpg is smaller but lossy. png is lossless but heavy
