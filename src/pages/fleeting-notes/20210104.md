- Tweaks to my gridsome source plugin. Added documentation. Thinking about if I should be adding in the extras computed properties or if that is outside the scope of the plugin. If can be done outside of the plugin perhaps that is the cleaner solution?
- Read a small section of Deep Work. Ritualise your deep work time. Plan where you will work, how long. Sort out any prep before hand e.g get your water, coffee, snacks.
