- refactor m4m UI designs away from absoloute positioning. thinking css in relative units using something like `flex` makes layouts so much easier to reason with. The hardest thing is thinking about responsive design in mockups which dont factor it. I want to always incorporate responsive design into web work that I do.interpolating responsive design into my work is tricky but flex honestly makes it a lot easier!
