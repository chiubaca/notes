- Learning making client side GQL mutations using the apollo `useMutation` hook. First argument is a string of the GQL query. It also another options object of which one of the properties is `refetchQueries`. here another GQL query can provided which which be executed after the mutation has completed. This is useful as some mutation may not return any data so a follow on query is often required.
