- Used jests [`test.each`](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#testeachtablename-fn-timeout) for the first time. The syntax is kinda confusing but I grokked it in the end.
  ```js
  test.each([
    [1, 1, 2],
    [1, 2, 3],
    [2, 1, 3],
  ])(".add(%i, %i)", (a, b, expected) => {
    expect(a + b).toBe(expected);
  });
  ```
  The array of arrays passed is the variables and expected params for your test. The last item in the array is the `expected` value . You can have any number of values before which represent the aruguments or conditions of your text.
