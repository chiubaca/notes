- Good progress on Whatch app, swipe events are being handled by reject or accept conditions and the interaction feels exaclty how I want it too. Cleaning up to the code to make it more type safe too
- Read up to chapter 38.5 of coding career . Didnt get too much out of how to get more out of Twitter. But still some good tips in there to take on board. I like the idea that twitter is for people you _will_ meet in the future but dont know just yet.
