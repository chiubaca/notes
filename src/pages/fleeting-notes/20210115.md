- Read more Deep Work.
  - Practice being bored. Dont reach for the internet / smart phone at the first moment of boredom. Work through the boredom. Condition the mind.
  - Work like Teddy Roosevelt . Work intensely for short periods of time.
    > Estimate how long you'd normally put aside for an obligation... give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time...There should only be one possible way to get the task done..._working with great intensity_
  - Meditate Productively. When doing something physcally demanding but not mentally demanding. Think intensely about the problem. Like in Mindfulness, when the mind wanders, bring back to the problem.
    - watch out for problem loops, exit out of them by acknowledge you're in a loop and move on to the next problem
    - structure your deep thinking. Work in layers, progress slowly down the layers of the problem when thinking.
