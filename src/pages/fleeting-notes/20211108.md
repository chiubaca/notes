- Well i spent one half the day learning about raycasting in three.js then I got completley side tracked and forked cloud-to-butt and created [web3-to-butt](https://github.com/chiubaca/web3-to-butt) ðŸ˜†

( Ok so did end up finishing the threejs journey on raycaster )

- [Raycaster](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=raycaster#api/en/core/Raycaster) is a technique that can be used to pick up mouse clicks in a 3D space. it sort of works by shooting a direct line a.k.a vector. 

 - set up an raycaster with `THREE.Raycaster();`

- this little boilerplate let you hover over 3D object and "react' to the event

 ```js
 /**
 * Animate
 */
const clock = new THREE.Clock();

const tick = () => {
  const elapsedTime = clock.getElapsedTime();
  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);
  const objectsToTest = [object1, object2, object3];
  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(objectsToTest);

  for (const intersect of intersects) {
    intersect.object.material.color.set("#0000ff");
  }

  for (const object of objectsToTest) {
    if (!intersects.find((intersect) => intersect.object === object)) {
      object.material.color.set("#ff0000");
    }
  }

  // Update controls
  controls.update();

  // Render
  renderer.render(scene, camera);

  // Call tick again on the next frame
  window.requestAnimationFrame(tick);
};

tick();

 
 ```
 
 - mouse `onclick` events can also be intercepted here too but will require setting up another event listener.
