- Starting to learn about [use-gesture](https://use-gesture.netlify.app/). Great little tutorial on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBWhAGhw7wM

- use-gesture tries to make it easy to add new gesture primatives such `onClick` and extend to lots more gestures like `onDrag` and `onPinch` so we can create much more native like experiences.
- It works well with react with some out the box hooks. The boilerplate code is quite simple

```jsx
function MyComponent(){

	const myDomRef = useRef()

	useGesture({
		onDrag: doSomething(event)
		domTarget: myDomRef
	})


	return <div ref={myDomRef}> hey </div>
}
```

- the library does not do the work to move and transform dom elements, just provides the utilities to do so via the events exposed on the callbacks.
- Within those callback it's recommended to use an animation lib like Framer or React spring to create interesting touch feedback.
