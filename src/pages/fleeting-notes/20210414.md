- Got some great [advice from dev.to](https://dev.to/chiubaca/comment/1dan0) which has helped clear up my understanding of spies and mocks.

> jest.mock() vs jest.spyOn()
> Looks like here you are using jest.mock() and jest.spyOn() here on the same function. Usually, these are used interchangeably, but not together.

Another good trick to properly type `mock` and `mockResolvedValue`. Simply cast to `jest.Mock` like so:

```ts
(axios.get as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(fakeResp);
```
