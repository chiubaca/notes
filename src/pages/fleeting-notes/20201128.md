- Completed `Section 2. Filtering Data` on https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/. All stuff I have used in practice, but good to understand how it works in bit more detail.
- Read some more Essentialism. Resonated with the idea of _kairos_ . Learn to live in the moment and be fully present. This way you can be fully focused on the work that is at hand. Dont try to multi-focus. This will only result in inadequecy.
