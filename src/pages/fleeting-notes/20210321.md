- Worked on my dev.to gridsome plugin. Learnt a good technique to iteratively resolve an array of promises one at a time. Sort of deafeating the purpose of promises in some ways.. but really useful if you need to queue up a bunch of requests to an API without hitting a 423 error like what was happening with the dev.to API.

Some really awful [solutions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43082934/how-to-execute-promises-sequentially-passing-the-parameters-from-an-array).

But this is the best one i've found.

```js
async function printFiles() {
  const files = await getFilePaths();

  for await (const contents of files.map((file) => fs.readFile(file, "utf8"))) {
    console.log(contents);
  }
}
```
