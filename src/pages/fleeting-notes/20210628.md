- Started playing with [Astro](https://astro.build) for the first time. Super excited about it. It's something I've been thinking about alot, the [islands architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/) is something i need to read into a bit more, but if it's what I think it is. It's whats i've been dreaming about and struggling with re: webpack federation and micro-frontends. Just from a quick play around. I love how it puts HTML first and javascript last. It brings back the principle of least power. With SPA libs like vue-cli and CRA , it's been diffcult to not bring everything and the kitche-sink when making a simple app. i think Astro is going to great lengths to let us have our cake and eat it!
