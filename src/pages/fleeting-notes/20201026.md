- the one things starting have some interesting points current on page 236. love the "E" to "P" philosophy. Breaking past mediocrity by changing your mindset from Entrepreneurial to Puposeful. My work ethic is my strongest traight and in fact i lean too much on it and that's how I burn out and give up on things. When things start getting tough I need to take step back to see how I can make things easier for myself. This hopefuly will lead to mastery. 
- drawing a line under whatch app for now. Had fun with Tailwind and vue 3 composition API. Need to think a bit more about what my next steps are how they will take be towards my medium and long term goals.
