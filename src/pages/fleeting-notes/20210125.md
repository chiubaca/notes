- More work the Next.js project. MVP is complete. Feel like I have a good grasp on React now! Just need to add some flare to the project. Animations, transitions all that good stuff.
- Read some more Deep Work. We underestimate how little time we have in one day. A highly productive person probably only has 4 hours of deep work time in one day, the rest of the day is shallow work. Plan every part of your day otherwise you will succumb to only doing shallow work.
