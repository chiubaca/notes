- Trying to chip away at lesson 7 of Three.js journey.

  - the last two args for `PerspectiveCamera` indicate `near` and `far`.
    > The third and fourth parameters called near and far, correspond to how close and how far the camera can see. Any object or part of the object closer to the camera than the near value or further away from the camera than the far value will not show up on the render.

  🤔
