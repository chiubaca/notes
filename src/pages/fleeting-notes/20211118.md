- Learning how to import 3D models into Three.js. It's surprisingly easy! Even though there are a lot of 3D formats the industry standard is heading towards `gltf` which can either be a readable json format and/or a binary format.
   - there are are a few [gltf](gltf.md) variants:
       - gltf
       - glTF-Binary
       - glTF-Draco
       - glTF-Embedded
       - 
- to import a gltf into three.js
```js
import * as THREE from "three";
import { GLTFLoader } from "three/examples/jsm/loaders/GLTFLoader.js";

//...
const gltfLoader = new GLTFLoader();
gltfLoader.load(
  "/models/Duck/glTF/Duck.gltf",
  (gltf) => {
    console.log("success");
    console.log(gltf);
    scene.add(gltf.scene.children[0]);
  },
  (progress) => {
    console.log("progress");
    console.log(progress);
  },
  (error) => {
    console.log("error");
    console.log(error);
  }
);

// ....

```
- Note to import draco gltf you need to use the [DRACOLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/DRACOLoader) 
- 

- loads of free gltf to use here - https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models

- gltf can be created to have animations built into which can be activated using the `THREE.AnimationMixer`
