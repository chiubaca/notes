- Good progress with M4M today. fixed a bunch of bugs and made use of couple of third party libs.
  - Got GSAP playing nicely with Next.js. Important to use [`next-transpile-modules`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65689317/7207193) when including the ScrollTrigger plugin.
  - Using ScrollTrigger to animate underlines and circles with [RoughNotation](https://roughnotation.com/) is pretty fun.
  - Settled on using [https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper) for the carousel lib. Overwhelmed with choices.
