- I thought [The Devil's Albatross](https://9elements.com/blog/the-devils-albatros-an-algorithmic-layout-technique/) is such an intersting idea for making responsive designs withough media queries. It make use of flexbox's `grow` property to force elements to wrap in the condition where they can't fit in the viewport anymore.
