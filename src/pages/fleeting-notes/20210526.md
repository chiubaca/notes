- Carried on reading some more of [A Complete Guide to useEffect](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/) (man it's a long blog!)
  - Thinking about react in effects helps you understand why we might get into unintended re-renders.
  - Every re-renders is an function execution, which folds in values in the current known state. e.g when you run a `setTimeout` with a variable, then change the variable before the `setTimeout` has executed, the `setTimeout` 'remembers' the old value still!
  - `useState` lets you persist state between refreshes/effects. Remember when you update a value with `useState` this cause a re-renders!
  - `useRef` lets you mutate values without casing a causing re-renders
  - `deps` in a `useEffect` is a way to let React know the exact dependancies the component needs to "watch" for changes to then refresh. But don't ever lie about deps as a workaround to prevent a refresh. This can cause unintended consequences.
