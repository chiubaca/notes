- So it's been a pretty interesting experience trying to publish my Obsidan notes without the use for something like https://obsidian.md/publish. The first problem is that obsidan uses double bracket syntax `[[ stuff ]]` which is not part of the markdown syntax. Luckily this can be turned off, so backlinks use proper md link syntax.
- Next withing obsidan it's important that `New Link format` setting is set to `Relative path to file`. This produces urls which will work will `<a ref> ` tags. 
- The final problem is that the backlinks are reference `.md` files so urls will looks something like `../fleeting-note/20210928.md` the `.md` make the url invalid, so we need to chop it off somehow...
     - Netlify redirects to the rescue.
     - With Netlify redirects we can redirect our invalid url to the correct url. For example
     ```
     /fleeting-notes/20200910.md  /fleeting-notes/20200910
     ```
     - But we need to this every single file, so I wrote a pretty [simple script](https://github.com/chiubaca/learning/blob/master/scripts/updateRedirects.js) to generate the `_redirects` file.
     
- Also been playing aroudn with Astro alot and it's been pretty great. VS code gets little bit confused with `.astro` files sometimes but closing and reopening the file seems to fix it for now. 
- I love how it's _just_ html you're working with but with the component architecture that we know and love.
