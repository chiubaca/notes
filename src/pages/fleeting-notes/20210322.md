- Second week at NB and getting my teeth into more TS/React. Typescript still makes my eyes go crossed, I'm hoping things get easier I familiarise myself with the codebase!!

- Reading more of So Good They Can't Ignore You. Summary of the possible control traps:
  - It's dangerous to try and gain more control of your life before your have enough career capital. You simply wont be able to sustain your lifestyle.
  - Once you have gained enough career captial to bid for more control. This is the exact intersection when people/employers fight to keep you to be more on a traditional track.
  - The law of financial viability means is a way to navigate if you are indeed gaining career capital. Ultimately it boils down to, "are people willing to pay for what you do"
