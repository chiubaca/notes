- Completed `Section 15. Conditional Expressions & Operators` , learnt about `COALESCE` to default to null, good thing learning TS taught be about nullish coalescing which made this makes sense. Also revised `CASE` for conditional statments, `CAST` using `::` I think I now understand all the systax that is being used in the supabase slack clone starter SQL.
- Also completed `Section 16. PostgreSQL Utilities` and have better idea of psql commands. Think I will stick to pgadmin though!
