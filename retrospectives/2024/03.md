## ðŸ’ª What went well?

- My first full month at houseful and iâ€™m really enjoying it!
- chipped away at sticker ai and understand printful printing a fullfulment process a little bit betterâ€¦

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- Energy levels a bit low. maybe caught something from being in the office so much

## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

- Find more time to work on side projects . maybe restart just one hour after work again
- Relax and unwind earlier!? (contradicts the first point , i know)
- discover new hobbies?!

## ðŸ§  Thoughts

- big focus on just settling in at houseful for now. I hope this can truly place I settle for a while and be the foundation for a big new chapter in my life.
