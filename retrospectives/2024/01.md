## ðŸ’ª What went well?

- Sleeping well
- exercising consistently
- got my new blog out there and starting to write more again

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- bomb-shell end to the month. getting laid off ðŸ˜¢. Not the start of the month that I was looking, but letâ€™s be honest the company has been a ðŸ’© show from the day I turned up

## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

- Bump up my weights again, cardio is in good shape but letâ€™s work on them gainz too.

 ðŸ§  Thoughts
- Wow, I took a gamble going into a start and boy did it not pay off. I feel disrespected, upset and embarrassed. But I'm keen to take this all as a learning experience.
    - Ask deeper Qs during the interview stage. What will I work on? goal setting, and financials of the company. The reason for hiring.
- Itâ€™s just the start of the year, letâ€™s turn things around and make this another awesome year!
