# April / May

## ðŸ’ª What went well?

- I turned 34!
- Passed my probation period at houseful
- Holiday in HK saw the kids
- scalp psoriasis is under more control with the Chinese treatment
- making time to learn about cloud flare and astro / side projects
- got my pal to join houseful

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- got pretty unfit from my holiday travels

## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

- focus on side project consistency
- focus on exercise consistency

## ðŸ§  Thoughts

- Still battling with stress and anxiety from work meetings. Trying my best to control these feelings, more meditation and mindfulness
- Consistency is the key thing to take action. Dicpline with fitness and working on side projects will take me to next level. I keep dreaming about the sass that I get to work on full time that brings me in in MRRâ€¦
