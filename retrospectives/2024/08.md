# August

## ðŸ’ª What went well?

- Found out that weâ€™re having a boy whos arriving in January!!
- Was fun seeing chan and the kids over the summer
- ran a 10k
- started learning Godot and Game dev

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- still not meeting work deadlines whoops

## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

- its time to start family planning more

## ðŸ§  Thoughts

- game dev is so much fun, it makes me happy. its made me realised i still love learning new things. that is the best bit. How do i focus that energy into completing and shipping something. too many unfinished side projects are building upâ€¦
