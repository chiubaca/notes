## ðŸ§  Thoughts

- iâ€™m hard on my self for not completing things entirelyâ€¦ maybe its ok. Iâ€™m just following where my motivation take me again. Iâ€™ve not been that motivated to work on much recently, maybe its lack of sleep and house hunting and life burning me out. I know if need to focus on my energy levels more this month. relax unwind and see what sparks my interest again. I have so many ideas floating in my head still. but i need to just let them settle. free time will be premium soon, its more important than ever that I focus on what I actually want to build / learn.
