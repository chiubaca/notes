# Lessons Learnt

This year has been one big hustle, from starting off the year getting made redundant and getting the zoopla job, trying to get through the first 6 months and delivering two projects already.  Jennys preganancy, house hunting and then ending the year with Calvin poping out earlier than expected! its kept me on my toes. I feel so blessed that this is all happening all at once. it is is a lot, and my sleep is poor, but i dont care. I just want to enjoy every moment , be present continue to push myself. What a difference from 5 years ago, where i was stuck in a dead-end job, annoyed about my energy levels and not sure what to do. Iâ€™m proud of myself. To another awesome 5 years to come, so excited to see what else I can do!
