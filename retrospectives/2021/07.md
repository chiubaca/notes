## ðŸ’ª What went well?

- Wedding planning is going well
- Feel like i understand GQL and apollo a lot better
- Work is pushing me
- Joined David lloyds. working out and gyming again!
- Energy levels have improved

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- Still didnt blog! (4 months stint now)
- No side projects on the go
- not reading any interesting books
- playing too much fortnite again!?

## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

- I might be going though some coding burnout. I dont *feel* like coding anything after work anymore. But at the same time I dont want to hate coding. Need to find that balance where I can enjoy building things but also not over do it.
- 
- Finish my GQL training/learning task. It will be useful for work
- After the GQL training. I can treat myself to work on something completely not work related for 30 mins everyday. Just like in the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I want to work on the poolside.fm clone.
- Carry on gyming consistently
