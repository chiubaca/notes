struggling to get my head around this quote, i've spent so long working towards becoming a developer, and now I need to step away from that identity?  Perhaps coding has had negative impact to my health. It makes sense I should now try pivot to healt goals. But somehow juggle to continual learning too. I cant let my health deteriorate like this. 

- I think i will need to just take a little break this month. With the honeymoon. I should try and take this oppurtunity to switch off!
