# November

## ðŸ’ª What went well?

- Gyming lots and feeling stronger
- Got through all the advance chapters of Three.js. feeling good about using 3D models but still so much more to learn!
- I'm super happy with [Hacker.fm](http://Hacker.fm) right now. Still more features to implement though
- I learnt twix reluctantly for work. but proved I have the ability to pick up new languages if necessary.

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- Work is still kinda bitty. No big project for me to get my teeth into yet.

## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

- Try to hit the gym consistently
- Prioritise what to learn/build next
- Carry refining my daily notes into blogs
- plan when to finish the rest of three.js journey
