# October

## ðŸ’ª What went well?

- learnt how to use shaders in three.js
- Started on hacker FM late into the month and I'm having lots of fun with it
- Been gyming again

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- Missing the sun a lot
- Work is hella boring, want to be put on a fun project
- [hacker.fm](http://hacker.fm) is distracting me from finishing the rest of three.js journey

## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

- Need to start writing up my literature notes on obsidian
- draw a line under [hacker.fm](http://hacker.fm) and finish the rest of three.js journey
- try and look on the positive side of this boring project. What can I get from it?
    - learn about design systems
    - how to organise it into code
- no need to rush
