# 2021 End of Year Retro

# 2020 Goals Review

- Though I lined up for a promotion at work. I need to leave TfL. I want to pursue a career in web development, it's ultimately what I enjoy. I need to find a new job which helps me grow and expand these skills further.

> Got got a job as a full stack JS dev at NEVERBLAND!!
> 

- I need to get rejected more! Keep applying to jobs and know that a good majority of these jobs will not be successful.

> I was offered a job as a JS dev from two places! Iâ€™m pretty sure I would have got to the next vodaphone interview round too. Natoora offered me a job just based on my github and [dev.to](http://dev.to) blogs. The power of LIP
> 

- Better side project/ life balance. Funny because I have great work life balance. I probably spend too much time on side projects?

> Side project have definitely been difficult this year, working as full time dev and depleted my motivation to work on personal stuff after work. But this is a good and bad thing. I am chilling out more in the evenings.
> 

- More focus on my side projects. I want to monetise something, but what? I need to know what that *thing* i want to build is!

> I still have not figured out what this project is. Only dabbled with [hacker.fm](http://hacker.fm) I stll want to make this postcard app
> 

- Don't let my healthy fall by the way side again. My physical and mental health needs to take priority among everything else. Especially my mental health which I have taken for granted for so many years. It's important to be true with my self and not beat my self up all the time.

Joined David Lloyds with Jenny and been working out more!

- Read lots again . Aim to read 5 books

> I read a lot this year, maybe not 5 books though... But Iâ€™m tracking everything iâ€™ve read here - https://github.com/chiubaca/learning
> 

- Write more! try to get a blog out every other month.

> I didâ€™nt hit a blog every month. But I got some new blogs out this year. It has been a struggle with the new job thats for sure!
