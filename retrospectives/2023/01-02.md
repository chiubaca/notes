# January / Febuary

## ðŸ’ª What went well?

- Meditating consistently Iâ€™m at balance advanced VI course now
- Keeping up with my running
- Met up with the pompey crew
- Learnt lots about Framer motion/ animations

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- Forgot to do my retro for Jan!
- Jan was really tough felt quite depressed and down
- Febuary was a bit better but was constantly ill
- worked my self untill i was totally run down
- no work on side projects
- learning journal has gone pretty down hill
- Let my work projects get the better of meâ€¦ again!

## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

- Continue to priortise health and wellbeing
- Dont ever think about work and continue to just do the best I can.
- Challenge people when I think theyâ€™re wrong. dont just accept what theyre saying as the truth

 ðŸ§  Thoughts
- Its funny when you slip up on habits it all goes down hill in one go. Time to pick up the pieces and build up again.
- Lots to look forward to this month , skiing and finally BTBC!
- What will be , will be at work. Just do what I can!
