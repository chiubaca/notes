# Lessons Learnt

- Funny how things can change so much in year. From loving a job to hating it. I learnt to be more cautious at my work. When you love a job its difficult to have boundaries, but its important to have the split from work and play!
- Running is getting stronger but Iâ€™ve plateaued. gotta mix things up
- Iâ€™m bearing the fruit of all the work iâ€™ve put into learning to code now. Upwards and onward. I know I can code and build. But its time to make something FOR REAL.

2023â€¦ What an amazing year ðŸ«¶
