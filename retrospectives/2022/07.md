## ðŸ’ª What went well?

- I kept up with yoga and fitness
- stag do in Somerset was really good fun. went coasteering which put me out of my comfort zone.
- Euc

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- Spent a lot of thinking about shiba swag store but not implementing anything
- Work project was completely nuked and started over again. which triggered my imposter syndrome again. Appway is just not a fun project
- Quite a lot of scalp flare ups
- starting to get bored of the shiba swag store idea
- so addicted to fortnite

## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

- Work on shiba swag store more 1 hour every day
- control stress levels
- play less fortnite

## ðŸ§  Thoughts

- Flare ups still a problem but hope fully CBD oil and eucerin and aloe combined will help
- Stop thinking about the shiba swag store tech stack and actually just build something. It doesn't matter if its not optimal or correct at this stage.  I just need to prove I can build an eCommerce store at this stage
