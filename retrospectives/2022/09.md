# September

## 💪 What went well?

- Figured out a horrendous SAML workflow at work. Almost gave up but persevering as always and going deep into the topic paid off.
- Signed up for the Netpal walk and started a park run challenge for back to base camp. 5k every weekend for the rest of the year

## 😞 What didn't go well?

- Went crazy and didnt control stress that well with work
- Didnt work on side projects at all
- Not been practising stretching and yoga much

## 🚀 What could I do better?

- Trying to control wok stress better with meditation and exercise. Signed up to a year Balance subscription
- Trying to chip away with shiba swag store again

## 🧠 Thoughts

- Had a bad flare up which I was able to get under control. Sleep, exercise and eat clean is key. Just need to keep it consistent.
- Been able to control my scratching. “an itch is temporary, healing psorasis will be for forever”
