## ðŸ’ª What went well?

- Worked a lot on a shiba swag store signup page. learnt lots about mail gun and email servers
- Got a bit of horrible henley work out the door
- gymed a bit more reguarly

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- moaned a lot  about working on henley, was stuck on it all month
- feels like it took me long time to build a simple one page email sign up form
- getting a bit tubby!?
- hair and scalp still getting me down

## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

- Carry on working on shiba swag store when I can
- Try new Eurin treatment for scalp, move forward with trying new products to treat my scalp
- Try and do other activities that get me out in the sun . Golf and tennis?

## ðŸ§  Thoughts

- My head and scalp is never going to be same. how can I accept this and move forward?
- Will be back on an FNZ project at work. Will need to learn some new tech, but I need to make sure it doesn't overwhelm me. Lets get the work life balance right!
