# November

## ðŸ’ª What went well?

- Been running consistently every weekend
- Carried on learning about medusajs for shiba swag store
- walked to work (22km) and raised some money for BTBC

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- Slow progress on shiba swag store
- Been focusing on learning bits for work which meant i coulnt dedicate as much time as i would have liked for shiba swag

## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

- focus on getting shiba out the door

## ðŸ§  Thoughts

- Running has truly become a habit for me now
- I can do two things in the evening relax, watch anime, work on side hustle
