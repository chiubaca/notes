# End of 2022 Review

## Goals Review

- I want a payrise or I need to start looking for my next challenge so Iâ€™m carrying on moving up

> I got a 9k pay bump. I would always want more but Iâ€™m not complaining!
> 
- Lets BUILD SHIT!! [hacker.fm](http://hacker.fm) this postcard app. Lets make it happen. 30 mins a little everyday.

Ok [hacker.fm](http://hacker.fm) fell the way side and also this postcard app. Instead i pivoted to [shibe.store](http://shibe.store) which is live! it took me all year. I decoped the MVP aggressively after learning a tonne about the complexities of how eccomerce stores work from shopify to medusa.js to just using a simple eccomerce tempalte from next.js and using amazon affiliate links. I obsessed over this project *all* year. 

- Do a public tech talk !?

> I didnt do my public talk but i did do my first ever work tech talk which took a long time to prep. making environmentally websites!  something i want to revisit and refine.
> 
- Travel and see more places (if possible)

> we went to a few places egypt and teneriffe. Whats clear is that 2023 will be the year of travel!
> 
- Buy a house

We thought about it. many times! This was not our year for it. Recession hit and with so many travel plans. Weâ€™re putting this on hold until late 2023.

# What went well ðŸŽ‰

- I getting more and more confident with full stack web developer. Iâ€™m not longer put off from big scary code bases and i can learn anything given time.
- work is going great. I really love it
- I got really into running! and running 5ks every weekend!
- Iâ€™ve signed up to go to Everest basecamp in 2023
- I actually got shiba swag store [shibe.store](http://shibe.store) live!!
- Iâ€™m controlling my anxiety and insomnia better thanks to my garmin watch and meditation

# What didn't go so well ðŸ˜ž

- I still get occasional insomnia and anxiety, but far less now.
- psorasis is still taking over my darkest thought and brining me down

# What I want from 2022 ðŸ”®

- Prioritise my happiness and health. (Heal my psoriasis.)
- Follow motivation over money.
- Build things that make me happy.
- Visit awesome places

# Lessons Learnt

- Work or my side hustles can take over my mind and mental wellbeing. I want to work on everything but I cant. I need to be realistic about the scope of my project. Shiba swag store took me *all year* to build!
- my ability learn and grow is limitless! my only bottleneck is time.
- my mental well-being is fragile. Protect it with everything I got.
