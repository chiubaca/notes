## ðŸ’ª What went well?

- Chipped away at shiba swag store a lil and learnt about Zustand state managment
- Worked on Appway a whole bunch . learnt a lot about sanity cms
- built jwei designs portfolio site
- tried a new tough yoga class
- saw red hot chilli peppers

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- Working with other devs is tiring. feel like chaos is just invetible
- didn't work on as much shiba swag store as I would have liked

## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

- Carry on working on shiba swag store when I can
- Try new Eurin treatment for scalp, move forward with trying new products to treat my scalp
- Try and do other activities that get me out in the sun . Golf and tennis?
- (same as last month!)

## ðŸ§  Thoughts

- Scalp is still getting me down, but quite sure its linked to my sleep. I *need* to get my sleep back in gear. I need to fight sleep anxiety for everything that it is worth

- Carry on with Yoga every sunday
