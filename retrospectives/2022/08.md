# August

## ðŸ’ª What went well?

- Been able to keep scalp psoriasis under control with cbd oil and aloe vera
- Been following my motivation trail and building Supa meet. an excuse to mess around mapbox, realtime features from supabase and generally just have fun with geo stuff and new tech
- Stretch lots and mobility is improving from daily stretching.

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- shiba swag store was put to the way side, again!
- Work is bit boring
- getting sad that summer is starting to end

## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

- keep tabs on my sleep hygiene its been slipping into bad habits recently, but iâ€™m recovering back from it quickly.
- Have been feeling a bit weak, maybe iâ€™m trading mobility for strength? its a tough balance. Going to try and keep up the gym routine but try incorporate more mobility

## ðŸ§  Thoughts

- Gym and sleep routines have not been the best but have keeping it up. just focus on keep up the consistency
- Not beating myself up over not working on shiba swag store. Following where my motivation train takes me with supa meet
