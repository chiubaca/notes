# What went well 🎉

Where to start... so many wins. New car, new house , embracing fatherhood, promo. Its been a really incredible year. Life is really beautiful right now.


# What I can improve 💪🏼

-  A carry of over from multiple years...still cant seem to figure out what to build,sell and ship. Its a dicipline thing I know. I keep getting distracted by my side projects, tech stacks and goofing around on silly things. I know there is nothing wrong with this. But the hard truth is, is that im not building something that can make me money. I need to reflect deeply on what is truly important here. learning tech or using tech to make something meaningful.

# What I want from 2026 🔮


- Hit 24 mins at park run again
- Renovate this house and make it warm and cosy
- Ship _something_ that is paid for
- Do lots of fun things with Calvin


# Lessons Learnt

Its been a rollercoaster year. It was stressfull trying to seal the deal on the house and get a moving date , but we did it. one of the most exciting days of my life, getting the keys to our home and walking in. On top of all this, raising Calving this year. my sweet sweet boy, hes growing so fast, seeing his milestones has been the most rewarding thing ever. I've loved every moment this year, truly. The stress, the 4am hugs, everything.

Despite so many wins, anxiety still haunts me. I think i know why. I gotta be more headstrong and try to live with [no-regrets](permanent-notes/no-regrets.md) . This life we have one shot at everything and we always move forward.
