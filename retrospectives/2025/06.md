It's a huge milestone to finally be able to move out of the flat and into this house! Its truly is the begining of a new chapter in my life. With Calvin here, a dev job which I enjoy and having my house for my family, I now feel truly ready to be the best possible dad and husband for my family. This year is a truly special.
