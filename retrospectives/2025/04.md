## ðŸ§  Thoughts

- been working silly hours, maybe making up for lack of hobbies right now?
- life is crazy right now, with Calvin , moving house stepping up at work etcâ€¦ lets focus on one thing at a timeâ€¦ put all my energy into this houe move, and calvin for now. everything else that comes after focus on it later. Theres so much i want to do, but it has to be done in sequence. when i try to everything i do nothing. lets do one things and do one thing well.
