- Excercise in general has been slacking a bit


## ðŸš€ What could I do better?
- Try to find time for fitness, do some weights everyday , try to go running twice a week.

## ðŸ§  Thoughts
This year is flying by. I cant beleive its autunm already. My boy is getting bigger and smarter every month. All of my focus and energy is on him. As a result I'm exercising less and find my self working late at night. I love this busy dad life, but it boy its tiring. The game seems to change from month to month. Trying to pace myself through all this is the hardest part.

This house is causing us stress too. We are so ready to renovate this pad up. I just want to build a beautiful home for my family. There is nothing I want more right now.
