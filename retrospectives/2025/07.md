-  had friends come over and celebrate

## ðŸ˜ž What didn't go well?

- didnt go to TSR much, was too busy with house stuff
- not much time for coding and side projects
- 
## ðŸš€ What could I do better?

 - try to go the TSR more ofter
 - Find some time for coding where I can
 
## ðŸ§  Thoughts

- New dad and homeowner mean there isnt much time left to do anything else. Maybe I should lean in to AI more, the stories I'm hearing about Claude code are now too much to ignore. If I still want build a SaSS by myself I _need_ to leverage these tools. In a way its lucky I was able to learn to hand write code before this AI revolution. those coming into this this field need to learn these tools and learn the heard way at the same time. 
- I physically dont have the time and mental energy to code after work now, especially when there is just so much to do around the house. But maybe. Just maybe, this is great opportunity to learn how to use AI agents to build something meaningful.
