## 🧠 Thoughts

A steady month. Thinking forward to the new year. some anxieties around this home renovations kicking about. its just a dream. a very expensive dream. will it come true? I hope so. but a part of me is doubtful. What i know for sure, is we HAVE to give this house the spit and polish it deserves. that WE deserve. This house is great, but has its problems.
