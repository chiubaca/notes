## 🧠 Thoughts

Life continues to be placed on hold whilst we wait to move house. Still so worried the chain is going to collapse, but everyone continues to hang on.

I've decided to I need to live my life and stopped waiting around for the house move before joing the TSR and so glad I have. I need keep up my fitness and running to have more energy and be my best self. work is work, but im its good, no complaints there. The rest of the year is still to come. How do i want to look back on this year when we get to Decemeber again?
