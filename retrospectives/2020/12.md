## Thoughts 🤔

feels bad to be blanked by supabase ceo, but take it on the chin. learn from it. I really enjoy the supabase product so it's a real shame. I take rejections too personally sometime you need to persevere through these situations. I'm ready to leave TFL, i just need someone to give me chance.
