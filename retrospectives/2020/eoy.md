# What went well 🎉

After getting reject by Piclo I realised there was some big gaps in my knowledge still. Backend and and real-life usage of front-end frameworks. I spent a lot of time on self development and I feel I have learnt so much this year.

- I learnt a bit more react, [https://github.com/chiubaca/fcc-front-end-libs-challenge](https://github.com/chiubaca/fcc-front-end-libs-challenge)
- I learnt more about Vue and Comp API
    - [https://github.com/chiubaca/fcc-front-end-libs-challenge-vue](https://github.com/chiubaca/fcc-front-end-libs-challenge-vue)
    - [https://github.com/chiubaca/vue-netlify-fauna-starter-kit](https://github.com/chiubaca/vue-netlify-fauna-starter-kit)
    - [https://github.com/chiubaca/whatch](https://github.com/chiubaca/whatch)
- contributed to open source, Vue + TS , Supabase, Nuxt.
- Tried to put myself in some new situations like mentoring at codebar,  put myself forward on vue ts cheatsheets.
- joined coding career community and engaging with swyx
- I managed to control my anxiety and sleep after weeks of struggle
- started taking journaling more seriously. I journal my learning, my exercise and my diet.
- leveled up in TypeScript
- leveled up in PostgreSQL / SQL
- learnt a little bit docker
- learnt about Tailwind
- learnt more about backend via node and serverless
- Learning in public has been a great asset!

# What didn't go so well 😞

- My wedding got cancelled
- Tried and failed to get a new job
- Getting reject by piclo hurt. But also Corona virus really knocked my confident in trying to search for a new job. getting ghosted by the CEO of supabase is also really shitty.
- still feeling quite demotivated in my day job
- i got anxiety and struggled with sleep a lot
- psoriasis is still a problem

# What I want from 2021 🔮

- Though I lined up for a promotion at work. I need to leave TfL. I want to pursue a career in web development, it's ultimately what I enjoy. I need to find a new job which helps me grow and expand these skills further.
- I need to get rejected more! Keep applying to jobs and know that a good majority of these jobs will not be successful.
- Better side project/ life balance. Funny because I have great work life balance. I probably spend too much time on side projects?
- More focus on my side projects. I want to monetise something, but what? I need to know what that *thing* i want to build is!
- Don't let my healthy fall by the way side again. My physical and mental health needs to take priority among everything else. Especially my mental health which I have taken for granted for so many years. It's important to be true with my self and not beat my self up all the time.
- Read lots again . Aim to read 5 books
- Write more! try to get a blog out every other month.

# Lessons Learnt

- Journal everything I have log for my self development, psoriasis  and exercise. By journaling and keeping a record you can see your improvements over time and see what is and what is not working.
- Learn in Public works
- Blogging and writing clarifies the mind
- Mindfulness wont solve mental issues, but will help you acknowledge why you feel a certain way

# Thoughts 🤔

- Learn in public has been one of biggest highlights this year. I never thought that my Vue Fauna Netlify project would useful for so many people, by low standards 30 is a lot!
- Though my wedding didn't go ahead , I took all the free time and turned it into self development time which is something i really needed to do.
- Overall it's a been a really tough year. I miss hanging out with my friends and family, but at the same time this time to get my head and double down on my self development was really needed! I'm apprehensive 2021 will be much different from "normality" perspective. But, I'm confident If I had to work remotely and collaborate with other devs in a job I could make it work.
