## What didn't go well? 👎

- Did'nt blog again
- Did'nt contribute to Vue + TS
- Playing a but too much fornite

## What could i do better? 💪

- Been spreading myself a little thin learning lots of different things. Though in the mindset of an Essentialist, go for bredth first to figure out what i wanna do, then go deep. I think supabase and postgres offers some really interesting possibilites. Having good understanding of postgres hopefully will be benificial.
- Need to get a blog out. Need to revisit Vue + TS again. Perhaps something on Supabase too?

# Thoughts 🤔

Starting to get a handle on my sleep. I think a combination of good exercise routine, relaxing at night, and some advice from chinese medicine lady and GP has all helped ease my mind a bit. Not been thinking too much about really long term goals this month. Just been focusing on my systems and habbits. Also making sure I have key fundamental knowledge in place like docker and basic SQL knowledge. stuff I have been putting off forever.

Overall, it's been a productive month. I can feel my changing. Greatness is ahead. I just need to dare myself to grab it.
