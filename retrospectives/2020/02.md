# February

## What went well? 👍

- Started learning React and build a basic calclutor app
- learnt about react hooks and class components
- finished the recomended track about react
- started reading why we sleep but might change books
- Got my first frontend developer interview and got to second round
- got the guys suits

## What didnt go well? 👎

- stressed way too much over the interview for piclo which has damaged my well being a bit
- really demotivated that they rejected me even though i knew it was 50/50 they would take me on. I knew that my confidence in my technical skills was going to let me down.
- lost a week of self development becasue of the piclo interview, was so mentally exhausted.
- didnt learn as much as i wanted about react hooks and classes

## What could i do better? 💪

- carry on working on my reading habits. switch to a different book is this why we sleep book is too boring.
- Carry on with my vue fuana template. lets finish it off
- start learning about back-end technologies. Maybe Django
- chill out, enjoy the interview process and learn as much as I can
