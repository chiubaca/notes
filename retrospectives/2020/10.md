# Thoughts 🤔

Really struggled with my sleep this last month. thinking far too much and waking up in the middle of the night. Is my mediocrity in everything that I do keeping me up? It feels like it. At the same time I know that mastery in anything I'm interested in is so far off!

Thinking long term is something i've never put into much consideration. "Go with the flow" has always been my motto. It feel more important than ever to plan ahead , but I guess with the pandemic i feel even less in control of my fate than ever before. I need to find a way through this. for the sake of my future and my mental health and well being.
