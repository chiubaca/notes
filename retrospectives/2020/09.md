- started learning Tailwind , Vue 3 composition API
- Started building Whatch movie recommendation app
- exercising and running more consistently

- didn't contribute much to Vue TS Cheatsheet

## What could i do better? 💪

- switch off from working earlier
- try and contribute to Vue TS more consistently

# Thoughts 🤔

- A busy week off spending time with chan and harry. could get much personal development in but still tried to add 1%
- having fun with Vue TS and interact JS on whatch app. Something I need to work on is design though. swear i can spend less time coding if i just have my designs up front
