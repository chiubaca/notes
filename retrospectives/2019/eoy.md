# Coding skills and career

Another year past.

This last year was defined by Vue and Jottivity. I spent all year building jottivity and it was eye opening experience and I certainly learnt a lot. I do question weather it was time well spent though?

Kinda cool I can see my journals visulised like this :

 I look at my colleague who has progressed up at work who has specialised in C# . Should I have done that? I sticking with my guns and sticking with what I enjoy. I didnt enjoy coding in c# as much as javascript. Hopefully this pays off at some point...

Vue Project text book and the net Ninja yuotube tutorials helped me get up to speed with Vue and felt extremely productive.

Vue , firebase and Netlify let me see wins quickly, i felt so productive working on Jottivity. Working out things as I went along got me pretty far, but there were certainly a lot of code smells which I didnt know how to fix.

Creating compoments feels intuitive, but i quickly learnt that there was knack and art to creating components. Making them reusable and not just a throw away. I still havnt quite got the knack for it. but I'm conscious that i need to get better at it.

It took me 3 months to learn about authentication , but also learnt about vuex in the progress thanks to open source repos from Netlify.

# What didnt go well

I couldnt get a new job this year and I didnt get promoted. I had interviews but my confidence i probably what let me down. I need to beleive in myself some more. Have faith I can get the job done.

My mood was all over the place . I felt demotivated at work and my colleagues are just plain annoying sometimes. I know I want so much more in my career but I feel like noone is giving me a chance. In reality , I'm shooting my self down and not giving my self chance to to out there.

So tired this year, felt lethargic more days then i can count

# What did go well

I learnt so much Vue JS! 

I feel like my JS skills really leveled up. I manged to sqeeze in loads of learning about Netlify and understanding the dev enviroment they faciliate. I feel like i have really strong graps on front-end development this year. 

I built the Jottivty MVP and i've been using it. LOTS! I set out to move away from Notion last year and a year on i've been using my very own built app to track my mood. So satisfying.

Martial Arts, jujitusu. Met some cool people and am learning some fun stuff self defence . Its tiring, but rewarding. got my red belt and gonna get my yelow belt this year.

Alans stag was a laugh

my wedding planning is full flight we have venue for 2020.

# What I want from 2020

I really want to contribute back to open source. everything its taught me. I owe it so much. 

- promote my vue-netlify-fauna open source repo
- submit a PR to an open source project. Netlify Identity

I want a new job. i said i was going to quit tfl last year. but I didnt. I dont necessary need to quit but I want a full time programming job. for the pay and the satisfaction of getting to learn and write code all day.

- Get my self out there on recruitement sites
- actually attend the interviews!

Read more.

- Finish 3 books!

Carry on levelling up my coding skills

- Learn React basics
- learn Typescript basics

# Wrap up

I felt really demotivated at the end of 2019. mainly due to career stuff. but writing this out. I have a lot to celebrate and be proud of. Vuejs has been rewarding to learn and its going to set me up to learning React when I need to.

I'm working on my confidence year and will push myself to go those interviews i've scared to attend last year.
