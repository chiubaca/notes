- Learning about some React component organisation patterns:
    - Create "presentational" components which simply wrap the views for a specfic data loading state, eg. loading , error, success. There should be no styling in here. Each one of these presentational components are exported out.
    - Create "container" components, which re-import the presentation components above. The purpose of this container component is any further advanced logic and data fetching. Create "frames" for each of the presentational views above and conditionally render these frames based on logic of the component, this will most likely be data fetching related. There should no styling in here.
    - The container component above can then be imported into view component where styling can be applied. There should little to no buisness logic here.
