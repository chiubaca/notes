- Completed section `Section 3. Joining Multiple Tables` Great to just cover the gaps in my SQL knowledge. Love this visulisation of different joins: 
  ![postgres joins visualised in venn diagrams](https://sp.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PostgreSQL-Joins.png)
  
      [Cross joins](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-cross-join/) and [natural joins](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-natural-join/) were new to me but was really well explained at https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/. 
  
 - Finished reading Essentialism. Closing quote was good. 
    > Ask you youself, "what is essential?" Eliminate everything else.
  
    Book was ok, I apply alot of it in practice already and I try often to now overwhelm myself with too much going on. The whole book felt like snippets from Atomic Habbits, The One Thing and Do More with Less.
