- fragments lets us break down GQL queries intall smaller queries. like spreading an object in javascript.
```gql
fragment addressDetails on User {
  name
  street
  zipcode
  city
}
```
```gql
{
  allUsers {
    ... addressDetails
  }
}
```

it's possible to paramtize and add default args to queries:

```gql
type Query {
  allUsers(olderThan: Int = -1): [User!]!
}
```

use aliases when making multiples queires with different args
```gql
{
  first: User(id: "1") {
    name
  }
  second: User(id: "2") {
    name
  }
}
```


Union types work exaclty like TS:

```gql
type Adult {
  name: String!
  work: String!
}

type Child {
  name: String!
  school: String!
}

union Person = Adult | Child
```

Then we can use conditional fragments if the out of the union type returns different things:
```gql
{
  allPersons {
    name # works for `Adult` and `Child`
    ... on Child {
      school
    }
    ... on Adult {
       work
    }
  }
}
```
