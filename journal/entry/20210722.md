- Trying to get my head around `react-dnd`. Making a start on this [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyx3Ps20TOg)

![where dnd sits between the dom, vdmon and react](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18376481/126670575-326e970d-cd22-4fad-8dba-bb2d1276de35.png)


## Dnd Concepts

- Backends
    - confusingly, not something used in the backend e.g node.js. backend refers to events/intereactions that can be tapped into between the DOM and React-dnd layers. This can include:
        - HTML events
        - touch events
        - testing Dnd interactions
        - Custom backends can also be created! 

- Item Types
    - used as a hint for dnd so there information about what the item being dragged on or being dragged is

- Monitors
    - Communicates events from the DOM to React components. This tapped into on the React side via a context.

## Interactions between React

- Collectors
   - these are functions when turn Dnd events coming from `monitors` into react props. This refered to as "collecting props"

- Drag Sources
    - draggable components are known as a drag sources
    - drag sources contain information passed on from drop targets.

- Drop targets
  - components which are areas to things to dropped on are drop targets
  - they can execute function from Dnd events
