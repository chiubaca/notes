- Learning about animations in three.js
- like in mapbox.gl. it's all done with `window.requestAnimationFrame()`. I like the way Bruno puts it. `requestAnimationFrame` is not for animations, it's for running a function on each frame. 
- Frames are vary from computer to computer, more power computers can run at higher FPS. Therefore it;s important to normalise animations by using a some sort of timing utility. 
- three.js has `new THREE.Clock()` build in with the `.getElapsedTime()` method returns back the elapsed time in seconds. With this normalised value we can guranteed with can animate object consistently regardless of the computer it is on.
- Lots of maths tricks will be required to get cool animations tricks to happen. Remember that when rotating object `Math.PI` will rotate an object 180 degress.  `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` can create a wavy animation returning back to 0 
- GSAP makes animating three.js objects a breeze!
```js
// Move object back and forth
GSAP.to(mesh.position, {
  x: 2,
  duration: 1,
  delay: 1,
});
GSAP.to(mesh.position, {
  x: 0,
  duration: 1,
  delay: 2,
});
```
