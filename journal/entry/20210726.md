- Fun with the apollo cache today. My man (Ben Awad with knowledge again)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ7t20gFR14]. Basicly three ways to utalise the apollo cache
    - adding a new record automatically updates the apollo cache
    - adding a `refetch` policy on on mutations forces the cache to update, however this means there are two network requests. not the end of the world...
    - you can manually ammend the apollo cache on mutation with the `update` callback, within this callback you have access to the `cache` object which has some additional methods you can utalised like `edit` and `writeQuery`.
