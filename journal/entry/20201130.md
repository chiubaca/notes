- Completed `Section 4. Grouping Data` https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/. Learnt about the `GROUP BY` clause for grouping attributes together. Also first time learning about the `HAVING` clause. Very similar to `WHERE` which is for filtering specific records `HAVING` is used in conjunction with `GROUP BY` to filter groups of records.
- Started reading Deep Work by Cal Newport.
