- Skimmed over notes on how to write integration tests in React with Jest and Testing library. Testing library allows for your to easily target dom element and assert of text, elements or other components are appearing correctly. Jest provides capbilites to do snapshot testing and also mock functions and components to avoid running timely network calls. This is usually discouraged as we are diverging away from "real" behaviour, but sometimes can be useful.

- Starting to learn about why you may want to consider using Redux for larger scale enterprise React apps. Redux may be useful in situation such as Auth where every component needs to be aware of this data. It's unreasonable for every component to keep it's own state for this which is why Redux can resolve this issue by being a single source of truth.
