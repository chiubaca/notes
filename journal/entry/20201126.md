- Worked through https://www.robincussol.com/docker-for-js-devs-how-to-containerise-nodejs-apps-efficiently/. Nice tutorial on how to productionise an Next.js app (should apply fue vue apps) efficiently by doing the following :

    - have a comprehensive .dockerignore file
    - use an appropriate base image
    - decouple the dependency installation step to improve caching
    - decouple the resulting built application from the build step
    - purge the node_modules from unnecessary files
    
- Worked through [Tutorial: Node.js live debugging ](https://training.play-with-docker.com/nodejs-live-debugging/)
- Read a few more pages of Essentialism. Focus on little wins and system than encourages progress. Pretty much what I am working on with this micro blog. Every small completed activity is a win and should be logged.
