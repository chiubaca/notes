- There is some standard boilerpate code to ensure the canvas used for three.js is reactive to screen sizes
```js

  // get height and width from the window object
  const sizes = {
    width: window.innerWidth,
    height: window.innerHeight,
  };

  
  window.addEventListener("resize", (e) => {
    sizes.width = window.innerWidth;
    sizes.height = window.innerHeight;
    
    //both the camera and renderer needs to notified and refreshed
    camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
    renderer.setSize(sizes.width, sizes.height);
    
    // importantly the aspect of also camera also needs to be udpated
    camera.aspect = sizes.width / sizes.height;
    
    // important for retina screen or an screens that have a pixel ration higher than 2. No need to accomdate for anything higher than 2
    renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 2));
});
```
