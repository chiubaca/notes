- Learnt about DB transactions on https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/. I knew postgres was ACID compliant but never knew what that meant in practice. Interesting to learn about begining transactions and knowing you can rollback or commit changes before other users can see the change! 
- Read a couple pages of Deep Work. Funny how the example used for applying deep work used is learning SQL. Not taken away anything that englightening yet. Deep works required concentration without any distractions. Not rocket science.
