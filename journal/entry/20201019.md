- worked on Vue + TS cheatsheet, added some examples around typing refs and put it out there for review
- Read up to page 166 of the one thing. Interesting points about thinking how we have lots of objectives which are part of different goals . Need to think about what one thing we want to do to acheive each of the goals. ask yourself every day. "what is the one thing" you can do/complete for each of these things you want to achieve.
