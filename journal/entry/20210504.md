- Signed up to GCP to enagle route API so I could extract out a walking path from shoreditch to kathmundu. Coverted the route API output payload to Geojson using `@mapbox/polyline` . This then lets us plug it into the mapbox SDK easily.
- Learning more about mapbox studio. adding in data via studio vs runtime is interesting. Doing it via studio probably has some performance benifits.
