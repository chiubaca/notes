- More hands on leanring with prisma 2 today. Followed this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivpMErpykRo) to setup up a Next, TS, Prisma, GraphQL and have CRUD operations with Nexus. 
    - Next already has an API instance that comes with it so dont need to setup node seperately 
    - Prisma doesnt come with shipped with graphql anymore, but we can easily setup graphql with Apollo Server by creating a graphql enpoint in the `pages/api` directory, then add the following boilerplate to a file called `graphql.ts` 
    ```ts
    import { ApolloServer } from "apollo-server-micro";
    import { schema } from "src/schema";
    import { createContext } from "src/context";

    const server = new ApolloServer({
      schema,
      context: createContext,
      tracing: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
    });

    const handler = server.createHandler({ path: "/api/graphql" });

    export const config = {
      api: {
        bodyParser: false,
      },
    };

    export default handler;
    ```
    context is factory function which returns an instance of Prisma:
    ```ts
    //createContext.ts
    import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
    const prisma = new PrismaClient();

    export interface context {
      prisma: PrismaClient;
    }

    export function createContext() {
      return {
        prisma,
      };
    }
    ```
    
    - As Prisma 2 does not come with grapql server anymore and is more a library. This means that it does not come shipped with graphql CRUD operation out of the box. Nexus is a new library which can create these CRUD operations based on an existing schema. It has the ability to create queries and mutations and for a single or mutliple elements.
