- Going totally made rewriting my blog with nuxt. Driving me up the wall that I cant figure out how to parse dev.to shortcodes or find some sort of library that can do it. Looking into Gridsome, but perhaps for another time. Cheating and just put links to Dev.to instead for now and moving on with my life. Next, just got to make the site look a bit more presentable.
