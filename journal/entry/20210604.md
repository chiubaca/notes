- Been reading up about MFA for work. This resource is excellent [https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Multifactor_Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#implementing-mfa](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Multifactor_Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#implementing-mfa) 
- Acronyms
   - MFA - Multi Factor Authentication
   - 2FA - Two Factor Authentication
   - TOTP  - Time-based One Time Password (not Top-Of-The-Pops!)
   - OTP - One Time Password 
  
 - Nice tutorials on how to implement with node
