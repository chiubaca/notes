- First day at NB today. Learning all about the tech stack used in the project I'm working on. React Node, GraphQL, TypeScript, Prisma. 
- Need to add Prisma to my learning list now. Looks like an interesting technology.
- Learning how the project is organised into a mono repo. I like how it's possible to run each layer of the application locally, and how they have configured the dev pipeline so that you can point to a hosted "staging" version of the app.
