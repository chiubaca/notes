- After learning the basics of yarn workspaces,  I've gone down a rabbit-hole of learning about microfrontends. This is an advanced frontend architecture pattern that lets you stitch together different parts of your app using different frameworks. On the surface this sounds like an awful idea, the runtime overhead must be pretty bad if you're using React, svelte and vue all in the same app. However, the buisness case for when a very large apps is trying to move away from a specific framework, or if you want to different teams to own different sections of an app. e.g checkout and product navigation in an large e-commerce site. For own very basic use case of this I want to make lots of different utilities using any FE framework I want, but also stitch it altogether in a single SPA, then host it on netlify.

- I _think_ this is possible when you combine the various technologies like [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/), [webpack 5 federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) and microfrontend frameworks like [single SPA](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/getting-started-overview.
