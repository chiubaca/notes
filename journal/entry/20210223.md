- Practiced creating a small GraphQL server using Node Express and Apollo. Lots boilerplate code but in summary:
    - Make use of `ApolloServer` and `makeExecutableSchema` from `apollo-server-express` . This lets you use express as the middleware for the Apollo server.
    - Next we can define our resolvers which can perform any arbitary action. the resolver must be supplied back to the to the `makeExecutableSchema`
    - launching the Apollo node app is a graphql explorer app. very useful for exploring your data.
