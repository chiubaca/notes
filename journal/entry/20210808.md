- back on the GQL / apollo training. Having a second look at setting up the backend from scratch. referening my [old learning journal](https://learning.chiubaca.com/20210704/) which was kinda meta.

- This [guide](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-setup-full-stack-apollo-gql-codegen-prisma-2-0-typescript-react-part-1-the-backend-e9eae9518dc9) is still the best and most comprehensive i've come across so far which is specific to node, ts, apollo and prisma.

- Funneling the prisma types into codegen, means you get all of prismas auto-generated types along with the types of your graphql scheama when writing your resolvers. It's really elegant.

- Learning how to use `.graphql` directly in a node project. [stack overflow to the rescue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62290875/how-to-load-a-graphql-file-using-apollo-server)
    -  Looks like the way we do it a work is with `@graphql-tools/load'` which is also what stack-overflow recommends.
    -  this works nicely for my basic use case
    ```ts
    import { loadSchemaSync } from "@graphql-tools/load";
    import { GraphQLFileLoader } from "@graphql-tools/graphql-file-loader";

    export const schema = loadSchemaSync("./src/schema/*.graphql", {
      loaders: [new GraphQLFileLoader()],
    });

    ```


- so many different flavours of [apollo-server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/integrations/middleware/#apollo-server)!
   - When starting out, just stick with `apollo-server`. if you need to server other endpoints on the same node server, swap to `apollo-server-express` there are also many other supported  node backend including serverless!
