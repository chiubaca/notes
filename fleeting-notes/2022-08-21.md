- [React useEffect firing twice in development](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development) is causing me so much pain still can't figure out how to make this work with Supabase real time subscriptions cleanly. [Asking for help](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/8573)

- Looking at svelte kit again
	- `+page.js` is a new convention that indicate there is some additional server logic that needs to be run before the page is rendered. Is this the equivalent of `getServerSideProps`  ?

  - [Nested layouts](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/8573)
	  - note `+layout.js` mean each layout can also have it own server side logic
