- Managed to successfully wire up PrismicCMS with Next.js as static blog site. Love how Astro.js copied how `staticProps` and `staticPaths`. This made it so much easier to figure out in Next.js-land.

- PrismicCMS returns rich text in a really verbose JSON format which needs to be serialized into HTML, it could be done by hand but luckily there is a hand React component that handles it all for you : https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/rendering-the-rich-text-and-title-field-reactjs#output-as-a-component
