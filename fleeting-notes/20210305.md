  - "Define Good". At what point do you quantify your skills as "good". Try and find something that is measureable. From a development perspective, perhaps it could be I can build "x" kind of apps.

  - "Be Patient". Realise that what you do today is setting laying down the seeds which you can only reap in 20, 30 or 40 years time.
