- Learning about the basics of Prisma 2. The slightly confusing thing about Prisma 2 is that is many things, it's worth understanding that it is totally different product to Prisma 1. Not drilled into the difference between the two product but some useful information [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/upgrade-guides/upgrade-from-prisma-1/how-to-upgrade).

- What I understand about Prisma 2 so far.
  - It currently supports PostgreSQL, My SQL and SQL Lite. MongoDB support coming soon.
  - DB schemas are defined using a `schema.prsisma` file which uses graphql-like syntax.
  - In here the db source is defined with `datasource`
  - The rest of the db schemas can also be defined in their own `model` blocks. There are lots of additional [attributes/directives/modifers that can be used](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference/), so that you have more control over the feild types and creating relationships with other tables.
  - Once schemas are defined you need to run `prisma migrate` which will create real db schemas based on what was provided in the `prisma.schema` file. It will handle db migrations too.
  - When working with Prisma in node, you will be using the `@prisma/client`. Under the hood , the client knows to read the `prisma.schema` and generate a client that is tailored to your models.
  - The prisma client can thought of as a query model builder.
