publishing my big-two game to the android play store has been a good learning experience .

1. include a manifest file to make it a barebones PWA
   
2. convert  it to a TWA, with bubblewrap https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/bubblewrap/tree/main/packages/cli 
     - also follow this  guide https://developers.google.com/codelabs
   
3.  sign up, verify and pay $25 on the play console https://play.google.com/console/
   
   4. remember to create a Digital Asset Links File, so the app can run in full screen
