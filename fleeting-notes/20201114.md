- read a few pages of Clean Code. Good tips about having not more than 3 argument in a functions. Anymore, consider using it own class ("options object"). booleans in function calls are bad, and should be avoided. Avoid side effects and functions should only do one thing! 
- Worked on todo app with supabase, implemented some auth functionality
- read a few more page of Essentialsm. tips on reading between the lines and keeping a journal for thoughts! good thing i am already :)
