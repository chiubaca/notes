- React server components (RSC) !== to server side rendering (SSR). 
	- RSC complements SSR.
- RSC streams in the UI diffs and React uses this data to update the UI
- RSC are really good when you need to run heavy js libs and stream the change back to the client so the end client does not take the network hit of downloading the library.
