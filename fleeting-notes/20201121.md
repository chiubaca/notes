- Automating this repo by generating a placeholder entry every day. next thing do is create reminder notifications
- Read a few more chapters of Essentialsm. Feels like I'm reading Do more with Less again. Lots of tips on how to say "no". An important tip for making sure we're not overcommitting and spreading ourselves to thin. I like the thought that saying no takes courage. Remember that short term awkwardness from saying now will lead to long term respest when executed correctly.
