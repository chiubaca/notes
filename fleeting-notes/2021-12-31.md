- Enjoying svelte.js the more I use it. It feels more Vue.js but with much more concise syntax. The out the box two-way data bindings for elements like `audio` is amazing and has made syncing up state trivial. Store are are _just_ updateable objects no need to think about the flux pattern which i'm not sure is a good or bad thing yet.
