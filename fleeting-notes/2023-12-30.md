- Very happy with the work I've done in consolidating a bunch of code for my websites on `*chiubaca.com`  into a single nx mono-repo at https://github.com/chiubaca/chiubaca-monorepo  . My favourite aspect is that both notes.chiubaca.com and chiubaca.com are driven 100% my notes in _this_ obsidian vault. This is made possible because both obsidian and Astro.js treat yaml frontmatter as first class citizens within their products so the I can do almost anything I want in terms of data manipulation as long as I have consistent frontmatter across all my notes. A big write up of this is needed
