I didn't get fly.io for the longest time. It is probably because I have been spoiled by Vercel, netlify and the like.  Writing a docker file has never been a thing I enjoyed, LLMs have made it easier. but Flyio forcing me to do it has been a great way to level up my skills.

Realising I have a full VM to work within in flying is the eureka moment. in my docker file, I can configure any Linux dependency. I can even set up SQLite next to my application and have it all run on the same instance! not sure if it's recommended, but it works, and that's cool.
