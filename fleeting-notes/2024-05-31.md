1. VITAMINS & MINERALS
  -  Zinc, daily 10-15mg (zinc to be balanced with Cooper, in ratio of 10:1 because, more Zinc will reduce Copper in your blood) 
  -  Daily Sunlight 
  c. Vit D/C 
  d. Biotin 30 mcg (only if deficient) 

2. Male Patent Boldness PREVENTION 
  a. Saw Palmetto 320 mg daily on a full stomach 
  b. Finestride 0.25mg 4 times week min (can have erectile dysf so take Rosemary Oil or Castor Oil). Use the spray version of Fin. 

3. REGROW 
  a. Scalp Massage, 5 mins min 
  b. Minoxidil, apply daily min 1-2 times 
  c. Microneedling / Derma Pen 1mm (press in, don't roll), 1-2 times a week 
  d. Gelatine supplementation (make hair thicker). Gelatin is made from animal collagen such as bones, skin, tendons and ligaments. 

4. AVOID 
  a. Processed foods, smoking & alcohol 
  b. Dehydration, stress, poor sleep, showering with Fluoride 

Note; 
1. Take Biotin if Deficiency, Minoxidil doesn't prevent hair loss, Finastride is a must but has side effects. They come in sprays and oils so use those topical ones. 
2. Try natural ways, avoid all oral medication and try topical ways as much as possible. 
3. There are two DHT pathways in our body. Saw Palmetto can only block one pathway and apparently, Finestride blocks the other. But try only Saw Palmetto first and see before you can try the spray version of Finestride because, it seems unavoidable.
