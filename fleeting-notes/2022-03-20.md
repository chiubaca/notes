- [tiny-invariant](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiny-invariant) is neat TS helper for managing data that either `null` or `undefined`, but you know with confidence that the data _should_ always be ok. If its not you accept your programme will blow up. This can help save many lines of of type guarding logic.
