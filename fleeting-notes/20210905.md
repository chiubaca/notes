- Still chipping away at the three.js journey camera lesson! Lots magic numbers to remember
  - aspect ratio can be figured out like so:
  ```js
  const sizes = {
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
  };
  const aspectRatio = sizes.width / sizes.height;
  ```
  - When tracking the mouse, we need to covert the pixel coordinates to normalises matrix grid. So that mouse tracking behaves consistently acorss screen sizes.
  ```
  window.addEventListener("mousemove", (e) => {
    cursor.x = e.clientX / sizes.width - 0.5;
    cursor.y = e.clientY / sizes.height - 0.5;
    console.log("hey", cursor);
  });
  ```
  - it doesnt necessarily have to be `0.5`
