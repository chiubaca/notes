- Mailgun automatically put me on the foundation plan when my trial ran out. Fortunately after a q support ticket they refunded me and put me on the on documented "Flex" plan which give me 1000 emails free a month. this is not as competitive as SendGrid which allow for 100 emails a day forever...

- [mailer lite](https://www.mailerlite.com/) might be another email service to check out.
