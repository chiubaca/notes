- Read up to chapter 33.10 of coding career, loved the chapter about going to the extra mile with everything you do and trying to make people smile. makes you very marketable if you can just make people smile!
- More progress with Whatch app got recomendation endpoint working nicely and have wired up to the front end so you can get recomended movies after selecting a movie you have enjoyed previously. Great typescript practice narrowing types down which is what i was struggling with the day before.
