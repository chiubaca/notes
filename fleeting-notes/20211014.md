- Fun building a 3D scene with just Three.js primatives e.g with just built in geometies like `SphereGeometry` and `BoxGeometry`. You can get pretty far.

- Learnt about how to make high fidelity animations with [theatrejs](https://www.theatrejs.com/). First time i have seen a UI in conjunction with code to build animations. It actuall makes a lot of sense! It combines the best bits of dat.gui and GSAP to create an intuitive animation authoring experience.
