- docker-compose is a docker script to run multiple docker commands in one go.  This is configured in `docker-compose.yml` file. As basic one looks like this:
```yml
# version of docker compose
version: '3'

# We can setup multiple services in one go
services:
# provide the name of the service, can be anything
	node-app:
# everything below here are the same docker cli commands
	build: .
	port:
		- "3000:3000"
	volumes:
	# docker compose let you use relative path for volumes
		- ./:/app
	# this is a trick so node_modules dont get overridden
		- /app/node_modules
	environment:
	# we can provide envs either explcity or with env file
		- PORT=3000
		# env_file:
		# - fileName
```



execute by running `docker-compose up` . To tear down `docker-compose down` additionally provide `-v ` flag to remove related volumes.

`docker-compose` also builds the image and will cache this step if it can. 

note: if you update your Dockerfile, `docker-compose` is not smart enough to know to rebuild the image.  use the `--build`  flag to force a rebuild of the image


- its possible to have multiple `docker-compose.yml` files perhaps you want a docker setup for dev and another for production.
	- setup `docker-compose.dev.yml` and `docker-compose.yml` - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zUHg7xjIqQ&t=4896s

		- then when it comes to running these files we can run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml docker-compose.dev.yml -d`  which will merge the docker-compose files together. the later script will override the former script 

- you can have if else statements in your Dockerfile

- `ARG` are _build time_ environment variables 
```
