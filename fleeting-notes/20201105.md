- low productivity today and just mustered up a little bit of energy to read Essentialism. Love the idea of spreading the net wide initally. Broadly explore lots of things before going deep into something they find interesting. This reminds of "Learning Gears" by swyx in coding career. It's ok to switch gears between Exploring , Settling and Mining. Mine when you think you have hit gold!
