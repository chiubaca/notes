[Articbase](https://github.com/PabloMK7/ArticBaseServer) paired with [Citra](https://github.com/PabloMK7/citra) is rather awesome. It sort of turns a 3DS into a switch like system. My understanding is that it fowards the signals of 3ds process to  a remote machine to actually do the processing! The remote machine is doing the heavy lifting in terms of rendering the game so if the machine is powerful it can upscale do or sorts resource intensive stuff. Really clever!
