- [This thesis on gridless design](https://gridless.design/) is excellent. It’s not about css grid but the design grid. Designing around specific viewports is probably a bad idea in the world of web. Web design is fundamentally fluid and should bend at will to all viewports.
  > no designer can anticipate all possible layouts. Nor should an engineer attempt to code layout exactly as specified by design
