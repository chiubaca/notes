- Progress on gridsome source plugin. Cleanup on markdown files by extracting out front matter. Implemented a time to read computed property.
- Read some more Deep Work. Allow for serendipity when possible and build an collaborative environment to foster this. An open environment for creativity is important but plan this space seperately to the space you need for deep work. Don't merge the two together.
