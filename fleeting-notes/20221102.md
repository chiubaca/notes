- Continuing with docker lesson at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zUHg7xjIqQ&t=1596s

- You don't even need to copy `node_modules` over to your docker image. Remember to use a  `.dockerignore` as basic one looks like this:

```
node_modules
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
.git
.gitignore
```

-  If we want to use docker for local dev, changes don't come to get synced magically. a new image needs to be rebuilt and run every time. A workaround for this is to use a bind mount volume. The full cmd would look something like:

```
docker run -v <full-path-from-host>:<docker-path> -p 1234:3000 -d --name node-app node-app-image

```

- if we want the bind mount to be read-only we can use `ro` 

`-v <full-path-from-host>:<docker-path>:ro` . 
this means docker cant create new files on the host machine.


- To use environment variables set by a user we can use the `$` syntax  in our Dockerfile
```
EXPOSE $PORT
```

	This mean can use the following cli flag when running the container `docker run -env PORT=<PORT-number>`
