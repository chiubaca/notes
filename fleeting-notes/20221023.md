- Slowly but surely getting my head around custom medusa plugins works a few hurdles to get by:
	- Classes in TS are still confusing to me, especially when dependencies are automagically injected into classes for you 
	- Learnt an Interesting pattern of taking injected dependencies and binding them to your local class.
	- when creating methods in Medusa custom services, these are exposed to your API, loaders and subscriptions which means your services are a giant class full of business logic. There's lots of magic around dependency injections and a new term of dependency container as under the hood Medusa makes heavy use of [Awilix](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix).

	- hit a pretty bad bug where I cant create products to the medusa database!? - https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/issues/2034
