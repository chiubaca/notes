- Implementing GTM at work, Google analytics has changed soo much , "universal analytics" aka old GA is what i was used to which is now moving to GA 4. 
- Also GTM is the thing that lets you enable lots of other tracking including GA4. Kinda scary to see how these script tags can inject other script into your website and potentially could just highjack your whole website...
