- combine `lodash/uniqwith` and `lodash.isequal` to dedupe an array of objects.

```js
import uniqWith from 'lodash/uniqwith';
import isEqual from 'lodash.isequal';

const arrayOfObjects = [
	{
		id: 1
		content: 'a'
	},
	{
		id: 1
		content: 'a'
	},
	{
		id: 2,
		content: 'b'
	}

]

return uniqWith(arrayOfObjects , isEqual)
```
