[On average it take 2 months or 66 days to learn a habit](https://jamesclear.com/new-habit#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20it%20takes%20more%20than%202%20months%20before%20a%20new%20behavior%20becomes%20automatic%20%E2%80%94%2066%20days%20to%20be%20exact).

Taking a second pass to learn neovim again. 

- Currently working through this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYDG3AHgYEs. It's starting from a much more grassroots level and configuring a few custom command. e.g stop copying stuff i'm deleting, vim!!

- Have worked through Vim `:Tutor`  (again?)
