Writing up notes on [fullstack-cloudflare-nextjs](permanent-notes/fullstack-cloudflare-nextjs.md) . I want to build on Cloudflare pages with next js so much, but there are just _too_ many gotchas and issues i'm running into. logged the following issues on the `next-on-pages` repo:


- [How use to D1 and drizzle orm in App router 路 cloudflare/next-on-pages 路 Discussion #775 (github.com)](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/discussions/775)

- [Clerk Auth causing Next.js to fail with 500: Internal Server Error 路 cloudflare/next-on-pages 路 Discussion #753 (github.com)](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages/discussions/753)


Next to explore,  [Next.js with SST ?](https://docs.sst.dev/start/nextjs) or  [Astro Actions ?](https://astro.build/blog/astro-480/)? with [cloudflare adapter?](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare)
