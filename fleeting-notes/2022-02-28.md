- trying to port my POC [page transistions](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nextjs-tfmzae?file=src%2Fcomponents%2FNav.tsx) into a real next.js project is proving difficult . Almost got it working but with a slight bug, going between anchors on the same page doesnt animate?! this works perfectly in my POC though...
