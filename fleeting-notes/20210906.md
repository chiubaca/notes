- I never use ref forwarding in react, but it's a useful technique for transferring refs from another component into different component
- By wrapping your component in a `React.forwardRef` function you can expose a ref.
  ```jsx
  const FancyButton = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
    <button ref={ref} className="FancyButton">
      {props.children}
    </button>
  ));
  ```
  - We can then reference this ref outside of this component like so:
  ```jsx
  // You can now get a ref directly to the DOM button:
  const ref = React.createRef();
  <FancyButton ref={ref}>Click me!</FancyButton>;
  ```
  - `ref` can passed around easily into any other component
