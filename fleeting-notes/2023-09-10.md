Agency life has been tough. No doubt about it. Reflecting on whats been good and whats been bad

The good:
- Forced to learn quickly and you _will_ level up in a short amount of time
- Learn new tech (at least in my company)
- Lots of projects so it's hard to get bored

The bad:
- No time to learn tech deeply
- Ship fast and test nothing
- Deadline pressures vary from project to project. But when its on, it's _on_!
- Lots of projects, but you end up just implementing the same thing over and over  and over and over again...
