- Tinkering away on hacker.fm. Got the media control implmented.
- The `audio` html element can take multiple sources:
  ```
  <audio controls>
  <source src="myAudio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="myAudio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is
     a <a href="myAudio.mp3">link to the audio</a> instead.</p>
  </audio>
  ```
  - [Partial hydration](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/component-hydration/) in Astro is magic.
