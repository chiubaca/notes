- ChatGPT reminding me how to do SVG animations:

> rotate a svg


To animate a group of SVG elements and make them spin indefinitely, you can use the `<g>` element to group them together, and then use the `<animateTransform>` element within the `<g>` element to animate the group as a whole. Here is an example that shows how to create an infinitely spinning group of SVG elements:



```html
<svg>   <g id="group">     <rect x="10" y="10" width="100" height="100" />     <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" />   </g>   <animateTransform xlink:href="#group"                     attributeName="transform"                     type="rotate"                     from="0"                     to="360"                     dur="3s"                     repeatCount="indefinite" /> </svg>
```

In this code, the `<g>` element is used to group the `<rect>` and `<circle>` elements together, and the `<animateTransform>` element is used to animate the group by rotating it indefinitely. The `xlink:href` attribute of the `<animateTransform>` element specifies the target of the animation (in this case, the `<g>` element with the `id` of `"group"`). The other animation attributes, such as `attributeName`, `type`, `from`, `to`, `dur`, and `repeatCount`, are used to control the animation in the same way as described in the previous answer.
  
> rotate from the center of the svg

To rotate an SVG image from its center, you can use the `transform-origin` attribute and specify the center point of the rotation. Here is an example that shows how to rotate an SVG image from its center:


```html
<svg>   
  <image xlink:href="image.svg"          transform="rotate(45)"          transform-origin="50% 50%" 
  /> 
</svg>
```

In this code, the `transform-origin` attribute is set to `"50% 50%"`, which specifies the center of the rotation (i.e. the center of the image). The `transform` attribute is used to specify the rotation angle (in this case, 45 degrees).

Alternatively, you can use the `<g>` element and specify the rotation transformation and the `transform-origin` attribute on it, like this:

```html

<svg>   
  <g 
 .  transform="rotate(45)"      
    transform-origin="50% 50%">     
  
	  <image xlink:href="image.svg" />   
  </g> 
</svg>
```

In this case, all the elements within the `<g>` element will be rotated by 45 degrees around the center of the group.
