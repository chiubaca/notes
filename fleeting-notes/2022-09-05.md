	-  OAuth never passes passwords around but instead authenticates users with `open id connect`
	- OAuth is an authorisation framework and provides a mechanism to authenticate via a central authorisation server


- Full workflow will look like the following:

- [What is "auth"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6wBYWWdyYQ)
	- Auth is authentication( who are you?) and  authorisation (can you?).

   - Auth always happens server side (on a per request basis). never client side.
   - You client (e.g a React app) can _only_ understand "who" the user is via server request where the server returns a cookie/token back to client.
   - cookies are usually best as we can use restrict javascript access to cookies
   - All subsequent requests to the sever will contain this cookie and the server can validate wether the client can or cannot access a resource.

- Authorisation workflow usually need to be coupled with a db. Your `User` schema in the database could have a `Role` feild with either `USER` or `ADMIN` . Access to resources subsequent could simply be done by checking this value first.
