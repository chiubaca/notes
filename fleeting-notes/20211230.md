- Starting to get to grips with the ergonomics of svelte. Using custom template syntax feels odd after using jsx so much, but the syntax is intuitive enough. 
- custom `use` action directives are powerful - https://svelte.dev/docs#template-syntax-element-directives-use-action
	- This remove the need to bind an element to ref then pass it to a third party lib. I like how it has handles for updating and destrying an element. 
	 > Should any elements that are fed into a third party lib use `use` directives?

- found a nice svg plugin for svelte - https://github.com/poppa/sveltekit-svg
