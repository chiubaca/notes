- insomnia hit hard last night. woke up at 3:30am. Made the most of it by finishing off the supabase todo app and submitted it for review!
- read some more Essentialsm . ironically the whole chapter was about sleep and the importance of it lol. Apprently some people look down on 8 hours of sleep as a waste of time...ok. weird chapter.
