- learning a lot about the sanity structure builder. The API is a _little_ confusing but I can see how it's very extensible and power especially when you simply just bring a react component anywhere...

- zustand is a bit of deal breaker due to the fact you can initilise hooks inside a store. For example I want to to intialise chakra ui's [useDisclosure](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/hooks/use-disclosure) and share it as a globally accessible action. Dont think this is possible with zustand.
