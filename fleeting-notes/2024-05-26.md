- more full stack cloudlfare with Astro. now moving into R2 which I wanted to originally test out for image assets . uploading images is straight forward enough, but reading the object again as images is proving to be tricky as we're working with R2 objects which might need parsing, converting.. etc..
  
  is https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/developer-platform/cloudflare-images/, a better fit for this?
--- seems
using the aws s3 client to interface with R2 is the way forward?
