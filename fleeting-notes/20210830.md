- learning about different camera types in three.js
  - The `Camera` class is not meant to be used directly, instead there are some common camera types that can be used instead.
  - `ArrayCamera` - render multiple camera, sort of like in split-screen video games.
  - `StereoCamera` - mimics the eyes tto create 3D scenes for VR headsets
  - `CubeCamera` - can be used to be render your surroundings
  - `OrthographicCamera` - renders of your scene without perspective, so all elements have the same size regardless of distance from camera
  - `PerspectiveCamera` - simulates a real-life camera with perspective
