Got notifications implemented for big two which was rather annoying. Turns out there are two web notifications apis. There is the  [`Notification`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification) which you need to use to check if a user has allowed permissions for a notifications on website. However on Android ( possibly IOS too?!) you don't invoke local notifications with this API (even though you can!) . You have to ensure you have a service registered to your website and you have to invoke a notification using said service workers notification method ðŸ¤¦. Its horrible ergonomics, but it seems to be working on Android devices... I only realised after reading this [PSA](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/BygptYClroM) that was buried away.

Main limitations of my current local notifications system is that when im in a different game, notifications from another game wont be triggered. I think the more robust method will be to implement push notifications which looks way more involved
