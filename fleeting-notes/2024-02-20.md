Using convex to build sticker-ai and it's a lot of fun! Getting into the weeds of how convex works is interesting. Its patterns and principles makes it a delight to work with. Things I like about it so far:
  - all convex logic lives in `/convex`
    - logic is clearly separated into queries, mutations, actions
  - everything is strongly typed
  - the auto generated api is awesome

things that are confusing:
  - convex actions sort of make React Server Actions redundant
  - Are you even supposed to run convex actions in React actions? context object seems to get lost.
  - i guess working offline is out the question?
