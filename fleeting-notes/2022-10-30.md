- Finally getting a chance to tinker with fly.io!
	- launch a Postgres DB with `flyctl postgres create`


- If you want to connect to a fly.io postgres with PgAdmin you need to proxy the internal url to localhost and on specfy port with the command
```
fly proxy 6543:5432 -a app-name Proxying local port 6543 to remote [app-name.internal]:5432
```

this exposes internal fly.io db to `localhost:6543`
