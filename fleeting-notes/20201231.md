- Happy New Years Eve!
- Working more on my Nuxt blog. What a pain in the ass it is to roll your own blog. For now I'm just linking to my dev.to posts, but this feels like a cop out. I would like to figure out how to parse dev.to md files better and process shortcodes... But this is taking up so much time!
