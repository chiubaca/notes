- Completed `Section 17. PostgreSQL Recipes` which concludes the basics section at https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/. Good set of tips which I can refer back to, especial removing duplicates sections. `EXPLAIN` operation is fascinating, amazing that you postgres can break down the processes involved in a SQL operation, very useful for troubleshooting an inefficient script i suppose!
- Got side tracked looking at installing other procedual languages on postgres - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xplang-install.html . This has blown my mind that you can run other language for postgres functions, including Javascript!
- Learning more about the difference with Postgresql functions and stored procedures. found some secret courses on creating [functions](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-create-function/) and [procedures](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-create-procedure/). Also been reading up on how procedures cant return values like a function but can return a values via the use of `INOUT` on [stack overflow](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/257596/returning-values-for-stored-procedures-in-postgresql). Now what's interesting is that [supabase can call stored procedures](https://supabase.io/docs/client/rpc)... Kinda like a serverless functions!?
