Really enjoying working through fullstack cloudflare via learn.backpine.com at the mo. 


- Workflows are awesome for parrallsing work and offeset when it will be completed
- AI workflows pair nicely with workflows as they're async need to run seperate from your main app.
  - Durable objects help bring everything together  as they can have alerts to run when something is ready and create websocket connections for real time feedback when say a workflow has completed.
  - service-to-service bindings has surprised me. had no idea this was possible! awesome to be able to connect workers together. have seperation of concerns and not compromise on latency.
