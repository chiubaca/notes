- Read some more Deep Work:
  - categorise your work into shallow and deep work. Sometimes we just cant avoid shallow work, think emails, organising meetings. So set yourself a quota of how much time in a day you have for shallow work
  - email are pretty much the bane of deep work. You have more control than you think. switch off your emails during deep work and become hard to reach
  - ofc there is a balance between the person gets deep work done and also being a reliable person. Balance out how much time you can afford to switch off from the world.
  - Use "Fixed Schedule Productivity" so you can switch off at 5.30. Saying no is a meta habbit that must be adopted in order for you to get the deep work you want get done during the fixed hours of work you have scheduled. This means saying no to frequent tea breaks... This may also expose some hard truths about your work place.
  - Plan every moment of the day so not a minute is wasted. Things will inevitably change. rearrange your plan try to stick to it. [Practical example.](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/)
