- why are fixed footers such a b%tch? Lets talk through the options...

- absolute positioning sucks, becasue it means the footer potentially floats over some content at the bottom of the page

- flexbox kinda works-ish. it means wrapping your content in extra divs and justifying vertical content with `space-between`. But this feels clunky and I'm getting a weird effect when the main content is centered to page, where I want it stick to the top.

- grid might be the best way forward. but it's not supported everywhere such as in a `react-pdf` context.
