Looking into installing Stable Diffusion locally and steps seem to have gotten easier two main options right now that offer a nice GUI over SD is :

- [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui: Stable Diffusion web UI (github.com)](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
  
- [comfyanonymous/ComfyUI: The most powerful and modular stable diffusion GUI, api and backend with a graph/nodes interface. (github.com)](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)


Comfy UI looks more powerful but AUTOMATIC1111 seems to be an easier install. Trying the latter for now.
