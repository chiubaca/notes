- Hit with insomnia. Read some more Deep Work. Learnt about four different ways to apply Deep Work
  - Monastic : In the fashion on Monk. Completely seclude your self from everyone.
  - Bimodal : Divide time in your day for big chunks of dedicated deep work. Slightly more practical than the Monastic approach.
  - Rythmic : Similar to Bimodal, but taking into account of more breaks. For example go into deep work for 2 hour chunks at a time, have a break and go back into it. Similar to a pomodoro approach. Most compatible with normal day-to-day routines.
  - Journalistic: Journalists need to be able to switch into a deep work mode in an instance if there is breaking story that needs to be written up. This an advanced behaviour which will take practice. It means you can switch in and out of a deep work mode on demand.
- Working on my dev blog. Quite interesting trying to use Dev.to as the CMS in conjunction with Nuxt and the content module. Trying to figure out to use webhooks on both Dev.to and Github actions to automate the publishing and updating workflows.
