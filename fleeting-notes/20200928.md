- read up to chapter 32.2 of coding career. Really interesting about negotiating your salary and not disclosing your salary when asked by recruiters. I've been doing it all wrong!
- worked on Whatch and netlify functions seems like overkill but good server-side/servless coding practice. Feeling really happy coding in Typscript right now. Need to figure out to level up and understand some deeper concepts of it. Other than that I'm feel realy productive. Made good progress with the movie recomendation API endpoint.
