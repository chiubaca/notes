- Day 2 of using Arc Browser
		- tab split screen is quite a game changer
		- as it chromium based all chrome extension still work without any problems
		- Extensions to update css on a website is kinda cool
		- Notes are a thing?! I already use obsidian for notes so not sure if this will fit into my note taking workflow
		- Feature idea, would be good if tabs could be grouped in tree view e.g all my github tabs are automatically grouped together
		- the mini media controls when your playing music on a different website is such a nice touch!
