- read up to chapter of 29.3 of coding career. interesting topic about megatrends and how we should keep an eye on paradim shifts in the tech industry. latch on them early!
- More work Whatch. Went down a rabbit hole learning how to create functions dynamically. decided to reel it back a bit. and keep the app simple and and need to undo loads of code. Lack of planning and understanding of the API means I've wasted a significant amout of effort and need to throw away some code. you live and you learn!
