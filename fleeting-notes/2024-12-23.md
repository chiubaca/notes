https://big-two-app.fly.dev/ all working on fly.io now. thinking about if I can drop pocketbase as realtime backend entirely

[Server-sent event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) seems like a perfect fit for this game as I'm only ever *reading* state. mutations happen via post requests, so I need websockets for bidirectional communication. 

time for a build!!
