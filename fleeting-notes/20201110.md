- Cracked a stupid issue i was having with supabase whereby i wasnt able to update or delete journals, but remembered i had to create a db policy for it! doink. Love the policy model in supabase. just plan sql for rules and very easy to understand. becasue it sql it's quite flexible too! Really liking the supabase platform.
- finished reading about tradeoffs in Essentialism. i dont disagree with the points about having to compromise on something to acheive something greater.
