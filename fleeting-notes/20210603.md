- Colleague share this [article with we about testing](https://martinfowler.com/articles/2021-test-shapes.html).
  - Testing is so nuianced becasue every application is so different. We have to find a strategy that works for the application. Therefore it's likely we'll never find a one size fits all testing strategy.
    > when anyone starts talking about various testing categories, dig deeper on what they mean by their words, as they probably don't use them the same way as the last person you read did.
  - So are we all using testing terms like unit, integration and e2e in different contexts?
