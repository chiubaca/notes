This [blog](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/i-deleted-my-second-brain) post has gotten me thinking about why I keep my notes here. Thought I was the original intention for this whole system was built around [zettelkasten](permanent-notes/zettelkasten.md) , my latest website design which uses these notes as a foundation has shifted to being _just notes_ . A stream of consciousness for my self to reflect back on.

I agree with the anxieties that come with a second brain, but I think there is still value in seeing my archive of thoughts. It grounds me to see where I came from and where I am now.

I'm keeping my second brain for now.
