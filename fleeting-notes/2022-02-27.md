- tinkering around with framer motion some more to try and achieve a page trasistion effect - https://stackblitz.com/edit/nextjs-tfmzae?file=src%2Fcomponents%2FNav.tsx

- Been tinkering around with the basics of framer-motion

- once  we motion from framer like so   `import {motion} from "framer-motion"`  , we can simply use  `motion` components like so:
``` jsx
<motion.div

	animate={{
		x: 0,
		y: 0,
		scale: 1,
		rotate: 0,
		}}

/>

```


- The `animate`  prop will animate css properties of that current div with the animate object
- There are also a bunch of animation helpers or what framer calls  "multiple gesture animation props" e.g `whileHover`, `whileTap`, `whileFocus`, `whileDrag` and `whileInView` . These lets us run animations when these gestures are active.
- [Variants](https://www.framer.com/docs/animation/#variants), lets us reuse animations 
	 
	 ```jsx
		 const variants = {

			visible: { opacity: 1 },
									
			hidden: { opacity: 0 },

		 }
	```
	
	```jsx

		<motion.div variants={variants} />

	```
	
	```jsx
		<motion.div
	
			initial="hidden"
			
			animate="visible"
			
			variants={variants}
		
		/>
	```
