- basic shopify store setup pretty quickly. Realised its $24 a month to run the store. I can understand why they charge this as it was literally so easy to set up a tshirt store with integration to printful. It was all set up in under  30 mins .

- Going to wire up the integration for with printful and code the UI from scratch to save a lot of money!!
