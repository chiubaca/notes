day 3 learning neovim. Made a lot of progress yesterday, cemented some useful vim motions for selecting blocks of text and navigating around., code actions,  TS LSP cofigured  , lazy git integration. Still lots that I want to get configured though.

- [x] vim motions for changing quotes and adding surrounding brackets
- [x] npm management
- [ ] biome lsp working correct
- [x] astro lsp
- [ ] better workflow for splits
- [x] configure telescope for searching across file. neo-tree is slow?
- [ ] tmux

ok figured out how `mini.surround` works now... 
its import to type `sr` / `sa`  fast to activate `surround` mode

a common work flow is to change classname to string literals in react

```jsx
<div className="m-10"/>
```


first run 

```
sr"`
``` 
which  [s]urrounds  and  [r]eplaces `"` for a  backtick quote.



```jsx
<div className=`m-10`/>
```

we now need to surround the backtick with braces to make it valid jsx with 
```
saa`{
```

which [s]urrounds and [a]dds curly braces

note: `shift` + `k` provide lsp hover effect, awesome for getting typescript details on a symbol!
