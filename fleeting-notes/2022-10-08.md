Testing out Medusa for shiba swag store

- There are [3 components to a Medusa store](https://docs.medusajs.com/introduction):
	- The headless backend is a node server.
	- The Admin UI, a gatsby application creates a UI for the headless backend. Live demo admin UI [here](https://demo.medusajs.com).
	- The Storefront. This can be any UI framework you want and Medusa has a comprehensive JS API to communicate with the backend. There is a [Next.js starter](https://docs.medusajs.com/starters/nextjs-medusa-starter/).
- [create-medusa-app](https://docs.medusajs.com/usage/create-medusa-app) is a handy tool to scaffold up all three components quickly.
- Looks like there is a Printful integration already -  https://github.com/olivermrbl/medusa-printful. EDIT, doesn't work...
  

- Looking into creating my own [medusa plugin](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/plugins/create) to integrate with the medusa platform, this could be a powerful workflow... 

- Conclusions after research today. Medusa provides utilities for aspects of an eCommerce store. the bits I'm most interested in is :
   - The admin store for organising orders and payments. 
   - Unified SDK API for stripe and PayPal
   - Its _just_ node API server which is extensible. Includes a bunch of bells and whistles like [cron jobs](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/cron-jobs/create).[ batch jobs ](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/batch-jobs/)
	

- The main challenges come around syncing back and forth between Printful and Medusa. 
	- what happens when 1 item changes? do all products from the Medusa DB need to be wiped and updated or is there a tidy way to incrementally updated?
	- webhooks to update things? Need to understand how the Medusa [events service](https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/subscribers/events-list/#batch-jobs-events) API works in more detail.
	- payments are just generally very confusing.
