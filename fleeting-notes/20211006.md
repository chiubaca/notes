- Progressively enhance your website using modern picture formats like `webp` and `avi` using the `<picture>` element. As `<picture>` allows browsers to skip images they do not recognize, you can include images in your order of preference. The browser selects the first one it supports.

```html
<picture>
 <source srcset="img/photo.avif" type="image/avif">
 <source srcset="img/photo.webp" type="image/webp">
 <img src="img/photo.jpg" alt="Description" width="360" height="240">
</picture>
```
