- Some neat TS tricks in this article https://www.cstrnt.dev/blog/three-typescript-tricks

- I dont use `ReadOnly` enough to enforce i'm not mutating things,

- `Record` is a utility type to make typing objects easier. 

- In fact there are loads of utility types to use! - https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html

- Some more shadow fun in Three.js, there a bunch of shadow map algorithms that can be used:

-   **THREE.BasicShadowMap** Very performant but lousy quality
-   **THREE.PCFShadowMap** Less performant but smoother edges
-   **THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap** Less performant but even softer edges
-   **THREE.VSMShadowMap** Less performant, more constraints, can have unexpected results

- Rule of thumb, try to avoid using dynamic shadows as it uses a lot of CPU. A good alternative is to use 'baked shadows'. 

- A cool technique with baked shadows is add the a shadow texture to a mesh and place the mesh directly underneath a 3D object. You can adjust the opacity of the mesh to create different lighting levels.
