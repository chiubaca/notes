How I think this Printful - Medusa integration is going to work


**Backend**

1.  Sync Printful store with Medusa
    -   This includes all products and variants
        -   Shipping costs

2.  Continuously keeping Medusa in sync with Printful may require setting up webhooks on Printful for when items are deleted, updated etc
    -   [https://developers.printful.com/docs/#tag/Webhook-API](https://developers.printful.com/docs/#tag/Webhook-API "https://developers.printful.com/docs/#tag/Webhook-API")

**Storefront**

1.  Render all products - [https://docs.medusajs.com/references/js-client/classes/ProductsResource](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/js-client/classes/ProductsResource "https://docs.medusajs.com/references/js-client/classes/ProductsResource")

2.  Use Medusa.js for carts/checkout - [https://docs.medusajs.com/references/js-client/classes/CartsResource](https://docs.medusajs.com/references/js-client/classes/CartsResource "https://docs.medusajs.com/references/js-client/classes/CartsResource") a. I would need a wire up the printful tax calculator around here too - [https://developers.printful.com/docs/#tag/Tax-Rate-API](https://developers.printful.com/docs/#tag/Tax-Rate-API "https://developers.printful.com/docs/#tag/Tax-Rate-API")

Regarding the payment and fulfilment with Printful. I'm unsure of the correct flow for this. In my head this how I think it should work.

1.  Confirm payment is received from the customer in Medusa.
2.  on the `order.payment_captured` event, I could fire off a Printful order via their API with details captured in Medusa- [https://developers.printful.com/docs/#tag/Orders-API](https://developers.printful.com/docs/#tag/Orders-API "https://developers.printful.com/docs/#tag/Orders-API")
3.  ???
4.  Profit ?!
