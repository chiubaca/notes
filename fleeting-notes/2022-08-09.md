- I got access to [Arc browser](https://thebrowser.company/) today!!
	- Day 1 impressions, the intro is an experience! Something akin to an Apple unveiling. Hypes you up to do something we do every day. Browse the internet
	- Side bar is neat. like the two finger swipe to go between spaces
	- hiding the sidebar and having a completely clean browsing experience is refresh!?
	- Control T for a built in browser omni bar is such a great a great UX. I think [omni](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omni-bookmark-history-tab/mapjgeachilmcbbokkgcbgpbakaaeehi) was way ahead of the curve on this one though.
	- Easels are gonna eat Exalidraw lunch?! (maybe not Exalidraw is much better!)
