Learning more about [Git Submodules)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) . Its meant to be used to link git repo together if they're dependencies of each other. 

Add a submodule to an existing git repo is as straight forward as this command

```console
git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/DbConnector
```


This seems perfect for chiubaca-monorepo where I need to link it to my notes repo. The last piece of the puzzle is if  I can get a sync working between that repo and my astro codebase. I have not been successful with symbolic links  on windows.
