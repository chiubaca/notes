- Working through more of the SuperForum project as part of Full-Stack-React-TypeScript-and-Node. Mixed thoughts on the way how this "real world" app is being taught. It's effectively copy and pasting code from github, forcing myself to read and parse all the code is quite slow and time consuming but it's better than just mindlessly copy and pasting the code which what teach styles seems to be advocating. Overall getting the hang of reading `useEffect` and starting to see how it's commonly used along with the `useState` hook in an API data fetching manner.
