- Feels surprising good to be back on react project after 3 weeks of twig/php! Had bit of a revelation around how React works vs Vue. React is `Pull`, the reactivity is happening via re-runs of functions so your mental model needs to be 'how do we react, once this function re-runs' Whereas in Vue, its `Push` system. We mutate variables and the things automatically update, We're not reacting to a change.
