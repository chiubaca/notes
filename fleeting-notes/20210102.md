- Worked on creating a Gridsome pluging with some success. Was quite a good experience. I think I can open source this plugin to retrieve articles from Dev.to. can enhance their API by having lots of additional properties like word count and time to read.
- Got distracted with the dev.to gridsome plugin and went down a rabbit hole of learning about mdast (markdown abstract syntax tree). I really want to figure out how to deal with shortcodes and how to convert them into some meaningful HTML.
