- Got mailgun configured to send emails from my chiubaca.com domain. 
	-  Had to add a bunch of `TXT` ,`MX` and `CNAME` records to my domain DNS which was _not_ on google domains but on Netlify as the namespaces had been forwarded to Netlify. #note-to-self

- When sending emails via EU region on Mailgun , make sure to include the `url` property when setting up the mailgun client

```javascript
const API_KEY = "xxxxxxxxXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxxx";
const DOMAIN = "mydomaim.com";

const formData = require('form-data');
const Mailgun = require('mailgun.js');

const mailgun = new Mailgun(formData);
const client = mailgun.client({username: 'api', key: API_KEY, url:"https://api.eu.mailgun.net"});
// console.log(client)

const messageData = {
from: 'Yoopster <joep@mydomain.com>',
to: 'mybestbuddy@gmail.com',
subject: 'Hello',
text: 'Testing some Mailgun awesomeness!'
};

client.messages.create(DOMAIN, messageData)
.then((res) => {
console.log(res);
})
.catch((err) => {
console.error(err);
});
```
