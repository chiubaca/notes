- Swxy urged me to contribute to vue/vite any way that I could yesterday. As always i doubted my abilities. Though having a look through this PR properly https://github.com/vitejs/create-vite-app/pull/17 . I knew that it was missing a shims file so I put a comment in. 
 - also planned out next features of Whatch app and which led me on to a potential blog idea about staying motivated with side project. Planning , keeping your project scope small and staying focused are important factors which i want to write about in more detail
 - Finished the coding career handbook. What a read and how inspiring it has been so far. It will definitely by reference handbook going forward. Need to find a new book to read now lol
