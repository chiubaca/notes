- Its been fun revisiting A-frame after all these years, funny how i was able to hack away at a mapping demo so early on in my coding journey and now i'm being paid to explore to a real life AR mapping use case.

- [AR.js Location Based](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/location-based/) has been very fun to work with. It's now a rabbit hole that will make me want to explore Aframe and three.js deeper...
