Mistakes I won't make again:

- Ignoring bugs that I can't reproduce consistently, they're the most important to fix.

- Being so burnt out that fail to tell others I'm burnt out.

- Not asking for support when I need it.

- Not pushing for planning when I know we really need it

- Pushing ahead with no real plan.
