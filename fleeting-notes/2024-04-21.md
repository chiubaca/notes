- A few problems porting an existing next.js to cloudflare pages, works locally, but getting a cryptic error along the lines of :
  
  `Application error: a server-side exception has occurred (see the server logs for more information).Digest: 2354650810`

  Cloudflare logs reveal the following error:

`"Error: The 'credentials' field on 'RequestInitializerDict' is not implemented.`


lots people seeing this error pop in various forms, one thread thats seem related...
