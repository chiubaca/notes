- Finally used `git rebase` in a real project. Have a better understanding of the uses cases of when to use `git rebase` vs `git merge`
  - `git merge` takes everything from another branch and stick in front of all the commits in your branch. This can produce a "messy" git timeline
  - `git rebase` "re-writes" history by smartly merging your commits where they would have resided chronologically with another branch and slots in commits into the correct place. This can often help with conflicts, but not always.
