- Completed an initial version of a calculator written in vue 3 composition API and using refs is easy enough. But my code is still pretty spaghetti . Writing with strict types is hard and I'm just using escape hatches alot! I'm also not sure how to make the code more "composable" do I export a `useCalculator` and call it a day? need to read some Vue 3 source code to get a better feel for this pattern.
- Reading source code from https://github.com/antfu/vueuse for inspiration
