- GQL codegen  was terrible idea due to fact the TS interface it generates is optional for everything, meaning defensive code for everything. Also the respoinse we;re getting back doesnt match the query given. so it's one big lie?!

- if we're getting the fill payload back regardless of using groq codgen over GQL codgen. groq codegen is superior as at least it honours required feilds.
