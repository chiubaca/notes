- Wow supabase just launched some amazing new features!
	- [GraphQL support](https://supabase.com/blog/2022/03/29/graphql-now-available)
	- [Functions](https://supabase.com/blog/2022/03/31/supabase-edge-functions)! 
	- [realtime multiplayer preview](https://supabase.com/blog/2022/04/01/supabase-realtime-with-multiplayer-features)

- I'm probably most exited about GraphQL. Even tough the supabase.js client is really awesome, it still does not have the full type safety which you can get from combining it with codegen. Will be drilling into this example to explore this more - https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-graphql-example .
