- You get SEO penalties for using Netlify preview branches as we now have duplicated content on different URLs . 
- The solution for this is to use `_redirects` to point all .netlify domains to a your live URL
	- Also need to remember to use `rel="canonical"` on all pages

- Another way might be to use snippet injection  which has access to build time netlify environment variable - https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/post-processing/snippet-injection/

- Seems netlify do restrict indexing of some of your deploys - https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/#search-engine-indexing
