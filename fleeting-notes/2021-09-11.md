- [dat.gui](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) is good companion for three.js. It provides an API to mutate objects. Therefore it will force you to abstract key params for your three.js project into a params system, The easiest way is to simply have a `params` object which you can reference when using the three.js api.
