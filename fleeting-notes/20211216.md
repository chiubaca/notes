- `animation-fill-mode` is a css property that can control when css properties are applied during a css animation
	- `backwards` applies the css property on the first animation keyframe
	- `forwards` applies the css property on the last animation keyframe
	- `both` The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, thus extending the animation properties in both directions.
