- Final touches on the automation of this website. I can now:
	-	Sync my notes across different machines using google drive and [AutoSync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.drivesync&hl=en_US&gl=US)
	-	`ctrl` +`shift` + `s` , will pull and push changes to github all withing obsidian
	-	`onpush` github actions is configured to hit a redeploy netlify webhook which will redeploy notes.chiubaca.com with the latest notes.
