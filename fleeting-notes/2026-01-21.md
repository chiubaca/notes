  Embarking on an agentic coding experiment of only trying to use claude code for building features.

initial thoughts of claude code:

 - feels futuraistic as af .  its taking away to the annoying bits of figuring out existing patterns in the codebase.
 - Opus 4.5 is very very good
 - Loads of new things to learn AGENT, SKILLS, sub agents MCP , how does this all fit together? gonna have to create new workflows around this.
