- Get file from a github repo via the GQL api - https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/6777b91e6374cdb5662b64b8249070ea 

- Create pages dynamically with Astro.js with [`getStaticPaths()`](https://docs.astro.build/reference/api-reference/#getstaticpaths). Note that if the params object includes any more data than necessary, the build fails!

- dynamic pages in Astro.js works exactly the same as Next.js , wherby dynamic pages are route based are indicated with bracket notation e.g `/posts/[page].astro `
