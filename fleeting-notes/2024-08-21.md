Learnt about the Event Bus pattern a.k.a global signals.

Instead of letting child nodes handle their own signals, we centralise them at the highest point in a Godot game state,[ an autoloaded singleton. This creates a singleton (class) available to _all_ nodes at runtime. If we set up signals in this class, we can invoke this signal in any node simply by referring to it any other node e.g. `GlobalSignal.hit.emit()`. This also means that any other node can subscribe to the events of this Global signal like its broadcasting from the highest level. This pattern has been useful when constructing a HUD for a game. When my enemies die I need to emit how many points that were to show it on the UI, the HUD. 
```
    GLobalSignal
      signal: points
   /           \ 
  /            HUD 
 /              - GlobalSignal.points.connect(update_score)
Enemy
- GLobalSignal.emit.points()
```
