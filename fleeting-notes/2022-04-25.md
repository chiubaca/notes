- Starting to understand the PayPal SDK a bit better... cross referencing between three different packages is very confusing react-paypal <-> paypal-js <-> PayPal JS SDK <-> PayPal REST API 
- The React package has been OK to use so far, the `PayPalButtons`  components have 1-to-1 mapping to to the paypal-js package so far, except I've had lots of problems trying to get the `onShippingChange` to patch the PayPal order in order to cross check Printful for shipping estimations.
	 - going to have to do this a different way. 1) collect the users billing and shipping address upfront, 2) send these details to PayPal via `onShippingChange` callback.
	 - Yes this means more to code, but also means it should make this feature ready for Stripe integration later down the line.
