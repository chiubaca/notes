- Made [coming-soon.shibe.store](https://coming-soon.shibe.store/) live!
	- for what is a seemingly a little landing page there was a lot of code to write!
	- Font-end Astro.js with a few components like the twitter icon and the shiba logo took a while to nail
	- Backend is all netlify functions one to confirmation email to signed up user, then a webook to save to supabase, then another webhooks to track when the email was opened
	- Kinda chuffed with the front end has 0 JS except for some analytics code. The modal is acheived by using css `:target`  which targets then a url query param appears which is updated by a HTTP header via a netlify function
