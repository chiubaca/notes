- First time as a coach at codebar yesterday. a bit out of my comfort zone but was a good experience. Was harder than i anticipated jumped in the deep end with with the mentee too quickly and probably confused the heck out of them

- Read a few pages up to page 65 of the one thing. finished the chapter about distractions and multitasking and how we should avoid it at all costs.
