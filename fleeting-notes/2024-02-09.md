Researching more into contracting life and what it entails.

Points from [Guide to software engineering contracting in UK (codedeepdives.com)](https://codedeepdives.com/blog/guide-to-software-engineer-contracting-in-uk)

- easy demand anywhere between 400 - 500 pounds a day
- work can range between 6 weeks to 6 months
- the feeling of job security is subjective
- set up a IR35 i.e a ltd company!
- get an accountant!
- getting a mortgage becomes more complex but there are specialist brokers out there for this
- get a business bank account! e.g ([www.tide.co](http://www.tide.co/)) or [Starline](https://www.starlingbank.com/business-account/). Monzo also looks good.
