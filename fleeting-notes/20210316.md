- Learning about some React component organisation patterns:

  - Create "presentational" components which simply wrap the views for a specfic data loading state, eg. loading , error, success. There should be no styling in here. Each one of these presentational components are exported out.
  - Create "container" components, which re-import the presentation components above. The purpose of this container component is any further advanced logic and data fetching. Create "frames" for each of the presentational views above and conditionally render these frames based on logic of the component, this will most likely be data fetching related. There should no styling in here.
  - The container component above can then be imported into view component where styling can be applied. There should little to no buisness logic here.

  - Once you gain enough career capital, you can demand for more autonomy and time off becasue your skills are so valuable, people have no other choice but to meet your demands.
  - At the same time you gain enough career capital is the same time people will trying to gain more autonomy over you.
