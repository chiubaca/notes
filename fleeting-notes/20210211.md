- More Full-stack React TS & Node. Revising ES6 features
  - revising `bind`, `call`
  - `bind` is used to replace the instance instance of `this`. if a function call that is reliant on `this` it will have been altered to the new context
  - `call` is used at the the function is being called.
  - `apply` is similar to call but the second argument you provide is an array of argument which will be supplied to for the method that is being called.
  - revised how `reduce` works
  - use sets for unique lists, use maps for unique object collections.
