- good things about Remix
	- simple data flow :

- Load the data right in the same component. (next.js 13 can do this too now...)

- Mutation with form actions handles server-side write functionality cleanly.




- confusing things about next.js:
	- The flow of data in the app is confusing

		- Map this order to file structure and you can see how confusing it is
