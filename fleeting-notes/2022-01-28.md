- noticing safari bugs in a work project with styled components where flex-box is not working without `-webkit-box-align: start;`   Does our styled components package need to be updated?!
- EDIT: AHH it's not a standard!! https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-align
- is this the fix? - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62791711/flex-item-not-aligning-self-with-styled-components-in-react
