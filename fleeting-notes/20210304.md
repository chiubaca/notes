- More backend work for the SuperForum project as part of Full-Stack-React-TypeScript-and-Node. Using decorators with TypoORM is quite a struggle, not fully grasping the syntax entirely but getting things to work somehow. Database modelling is still a bit of mind warp for me, definitely a weaker area in my skill set and something I should try to improve upon, creating table realtionships is still especially hard for me to get my head around for some reason. The API for querying your data in TypeORM feels much more comfortable. Having nice methods like `findOne` and `create` feels like coding with Firebase or Mongo again.

- Learning how the architecture for authentication looks like if you were to implement it from scratch:
  - Your `User` table can hold the record of the user and include fields such as `Confirmed` to indicate if they user account has been verified.
  - The state of if the user is logged can be managed by Redis. By making use of cookies, this can track which specfic user is logged in or out. This means that whenever the user accesses the app, there needs to be quick handshake with the redis server to check if they are logged in or not. Becasue Redis is fast, this means no query to the DB is required.
