- Further familiarisation with Nexus and Prisma. Getting a feel for the full workflow.
  1. update your `schema.graphql` file
  2. Run `npx prisma migrate` to create schemas in the db
  3. Run `npx prisma generate` to generate the types which will be used for graphql resolvers and also FE.
  4. Wire up the definitional for the gql server via Nexus. The `nexusPrisma` plugin is "aware" of the new schemas in prisma if setup correctly which mean defining the `objectType`s is stright forward as `t.model` will be aware of what properties are available.
  5. Remember to add these definitions to the nexus `makeSchema` function.
  6. Queries and Resolvers can now be created using the nexus `queryType` function.
