- Porting all my journals to obsidian and will adopt the [Zettelkasten](index-notes/Zettelkasten.md)
- Will also be migrating from 11ty to [[index-notes/Astro]].js. Always found 11ty a bit messy to use. The API for astro just seem a lot more intuitive and the bring-your-own-framework concept is perfect for progressive enhancement.
