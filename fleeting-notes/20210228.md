- More work on the SuperForum project as part of Full-Stack-React-TypeScript-and-Node. Refactoring React components is surprisingly easy and the VS code support for TSX is really amazing I can understand why people like the DX so much. I have notived that complexity can stack up pretty quickly in a component. `useEffect` is used everywhere and clearly an important hook, but it's difficult to parse in my head, perhaps it just requires more practice. I naturally want to compare it to Vue which has a much user friendly API. It's no wonder why front-end frameworks are such a common subject for debate. They are both just tools at the end of the day.Debating about which tool is better made does not matter if you dont do anything meaningful with the tool.
