- Got a neat on hover animation effect working with css - https://codepen.io/chiubaca/pen/gOGzEve?editors=0100
	- reversed engineered the 'Shutter Out Vertical' effect from [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/).
	- This exercise surprisingly stretched my css skills more than i though. at a high level I had to absolute position the `::before` pseudo element, this gives you a free `div` element to play with to create a shutter effect by transitioning the `transform:translateY(0)` to `transform:translateY(0)`. 
	- When we apply the `transition: all 1s` to both the hover state and regular state the animation transition both on hover and out. thanks css tricks! - https://css-tricks.com/different-transitions-for-hover-on-hover-off/
