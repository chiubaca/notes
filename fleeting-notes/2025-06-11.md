I like the concept of [neverthrow](https://github.com/supermacro/neverthrow).
interesting talk about - https://youtu.be/VcOIz7tOBoM?si=DdxZlZkEX48t4YJi
 -  try catch is hidden control flow and `error` is unknown so it takes discipline to check every `instanceof` and error could be, which is not scalable in larger teams.
 - neverthrow is useful when your service has multiple error states to handle
 - catch should only be for truly exceptional circumstances which we cant control.
