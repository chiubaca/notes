- Learning about realistic renders in three.js and it's just like configuring a PC game settings
    - Lighting is key
    - envinronment mapping on the background but also applying the envinronmet map back on 3D object mesh can give good results,. Very easily done with `scene.environment = environmentMap;`
    - There are a lot of renderer settings!
       - outputEncoding
       - toneMapping
       - shadowMap
       - antialiasing

    - It's a good idea to enable these all run them through dat.GUI.
