- Round 2 of playing with remix , thoughts so far:
	- loader function to fetch data for the client is really intuitive. I like how if you wanted you can put all that logic into a model dir. Its very flexible
	- Mutation of data via forms is also a very nice API. Dispatching an action to the server via a  `Form` feels like black magic but in action works really well. to have the data instantly available in another function which is automagically the backend streamlines things massively.  
	- the line between front and backend feels blurred with Remix
