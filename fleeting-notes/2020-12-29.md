- Spent hours rewriting my personal blog site nuxt. realised my approach to pulling down and saving md files to disk was'nt going to work in the context of github actions. When updating or deleting a file in github you need to know the sha of the file. So how do I keep track of the this sha? Need some sort of lookup table or something... Just seems overly complicated. Decided to make use of Nuxt asyncData which can let you pregenerate routes at build time which is pretty cool. Now trying to work out how to parse the contents of the dev.to post in a presentable way. Shortcodes are driving me nuts. Do I take the HTML which dev.to has generated? Or do I parse the md myself and try to figure out how to build widgets from shortcodes? Why is this so complicated? Might just take the easy way out for the time being and just do create links to my dev.to post for the time being. Figure this complexity out later.
