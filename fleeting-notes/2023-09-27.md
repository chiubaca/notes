- Working with Playwright a lot to crawl a website for data and its very fiddly but I'm making progress. The high level workflow that seems to be working is to use the [Locators API](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator) to narrow down the block of elements i'm interested then using `$()` (get one element handle) or `$$()`(multiple handles) to parse the block and extract data from a DOM element.
