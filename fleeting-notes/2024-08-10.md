rough notes from playing around with Godot so far:

- It is a half low-code, full-code game SDK that supports both 2D and 3D
- The game logic is mostly written with GDScript, a Python-like language with support for types
- It feels intentional which part of the software is meant to be used with a GUI e.g creating enemy paths and setting up 3D cameras. 
- Everything is a `Node`
- `Nodes` can be organised into `Scenes`
- `Scenes` can also be composed into other `Scenes`
- `Nodes` communicate to with other nodes with `signals` which send messages and/or arguments too.
