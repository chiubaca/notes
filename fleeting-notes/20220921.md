lets try to learn Docker again ! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ6WbK9zFpI

## Docker Intro
 - containers vs VMs 
	 - containers sit on top Docker which sits on top of any OS
	 - VMs sit on a Hypervisor which need to house the entire OS making them more CPU and disk space extensive and larger to transfer


- image vs containers
	- Docker images are packages or templates which can create one or more docker containers.
	- Container are running instances of images, they have their own cpu and resources


- Dockerfiles are used to create docker images
