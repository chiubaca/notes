Randomly ended up reading this whole blog on [how tailscale works](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works).

Tailscale has been amazing for my home media server so its fascniating to know how it works now. tldr its a global mesh network with a worldwide relay system that forwards on traffic via https, this is how it bypasses internal firewalls.
