- Revising TS with Full-Stack React, TS & Node.
- Revising how `private` ,`readonly` and `static` keywords are used in classes.
- `static` types cant only be accessed via the class name, therefore references to a class static property is forbidden. `static` type are therefore useful for sharing state across multiples instances of the same class.
- Revising how inheritence works in JS. When inheriting a class, the `super` keyword is the reference to the parent class you are inheriting from.
  - the `protected` keywords means that the property is still private to the class but anything inheriting the class has access to the member.
- namespaces in TS provided another level of encapsulation. Similar to classes in a way, but it is possible contain many classes.
