Making a custom agen with OpenAI is fun. you can create a bot with a particular purpose quite quickly with just a pre-prompt. its a multi-part process though,

1. create an assisstant - This can be reused
2. create a thread that uses an assistant
3. continue the thread by references the thread id that was generated

open ai keeps threads for a little while, but its _proabally_ not a good persistant storage solution....
So whats the solution to storing long threads? chuck it all in a DB?
