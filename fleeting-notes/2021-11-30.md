- Very impressed with forestadmin.com . It's a sort low-code way to edit data in your database (I think similar to Airtable?). The setup has been incredibably easy. 
1 - create a forest admin account to access the dashboards
   - The same login lets you manage multiple teams and backends
   
2 - install the server clinent
  a - connect it to the dashboard with like 1 or two commands
  
Thats it! Once it's configred you can apply model validation rules via the server for server side validation. What's neat is you have client-side validation which is all configurable via the dashboard.
