- Learning more about the nuiances of Cypress. When creating an application it ideally should built with e2e testing in mind. This means adding testing tags like `test-id="InputForm"` to elements that needs to be targeted by the Cypress API. Sometimes when component APIs are not using sematic HTML, it can make testing quite difficult. For example some drop down lists in material ui are a `div` with `li` elements in them. When there are no test tags that can be targeted, we may need to something "hacky" and target id or aria-ids instead, then search for (sibling)[https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/siblings#Syntax] elements instead.
