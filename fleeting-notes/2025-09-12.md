Getting into the good part of Backpine fullstack cloudflare course. Just did a quick section on CF KV and its almost too easy?! why would you want to use redis when cloudflare make it this easy?
  
  I guess one big downside of the CF ecosystem is how tightly couple it is too workers. There is very tight vendor lock in the best and worst part of Cloudflare? But when the DX is this good and the so cheap as well, maybe this point is moot? 

At the end of the day, any cloud provider is lock-in to some degree.
