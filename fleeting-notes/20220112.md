- Been re-visiting this blog about styled-component design tokens a lot recently. I like the ideas proposed - https://www.erikverweij.dev/blog/manage-design-tokens-with-typescript-and-styled-components/
   - I still think it's better than we have objects for everything, rather than having arrays where you dont know what the index is referring to. Using object keys as descriptors makes sense to me
