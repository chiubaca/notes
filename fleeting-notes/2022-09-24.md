 Stable diffusion experiments today!

- first off playing around with [Diffusion Bee - Stable Diffusion GUI App for M1 Mac](https://github.com/divamgupta/diffusionbee-stable-diffusion-ui#diffusion-bee---stable-diffusion-gui-app-for-m1-mac) . A one-click install solution for stable diffusion.
	- it runs slow! 5 - 10 secs for 384 X 384 images. 768 x 768  takes 5 - 10 mins
	- The GUI is also quite limited, no image to image yet
	- Pretty nice install experience though!

- Hosted Stable Diffusion - https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream
	- This is similar to the hosted DALLE2 OpenAI web version and is fast. Having fun with my usual prompt ["chewbacca going super"](https://twitter.com/chiubaca/status/1573637290878017537?s=20&t=Imcg2A8-GSRznk22c4V6vw)


- Time to explore if my Steam deck can run a local version of stable version with faster speeds than my M1 mac book...
	- ok first run crashed my steam deck becasue it was running in CPU mode.
	- interesting [video here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/ww436j/howto_stable_diffusion_on_an_amd_gpu/) but need a compatible AMD GPU which i'm not sure the Steam deck has..
