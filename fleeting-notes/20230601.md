Reading [React Essentials](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials)for Nextjs 13. 

- Server components cant be imported into a client components. However if client components exposes a "hole" for a react node e.g with `children` or a custom prop, a server component can be passed through here. This means something like this is possible
`
```jsx
<RootServerComponent>
   <ClientComponent>
     <ChildServerComponent />
   </ClientComponent>
</RootServerComponent>
```

- If server environment key which is not prefixed is leaked to client Next.js will covert this to an empty string
  - to prevent this there is the `server-only` package which can be installed with `npm install server-only` and imported in like so:
```js
import 'server-only';
```
  - Context will work, but will require to probably wrap all third party providers in a `use client` component eg:
```jsx
'use client'; import { ThemeProvider } from 'acme-theme';
import { AuthProvider } from 'acme-auth'; 

export function Providers({ children }) { 
  return ( 
  <ThemeProvider> 
    <AuthProvider>{children}</AuthProvider> 
  </ThemeProvider> );
  }
```
