   - Navigate to your geoserver installation e.g `C:\Program Files\GeoServer`  and look for the `web.xml` file under `\webapps\geoserver\WEB-INF`
     
   - uncomment the the `filter` settings . There is a comment `   <!-- Uncomment following filter to enable CORS in Jetty. Do not forget the second config block further down.    -->`
     
  - no need to comment out the cors setting regarding apache Tomcat

  - there is one more block which has a comment `   <!-- Uncomment following filter to enable CORS -->` . Enable the code below:
  ```xml
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>cross-origin</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
```
