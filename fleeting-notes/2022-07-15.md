- [Notes from # "Deno and Remix" by Ryan Dahl atÂ [#RemixConf](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/remixconf)Â ðŸ’¿](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBcFJmQ6UVM)
	- Deno deploy + fresh can be deployed and distributed to world CDNs in less that 10 seconds. This due to fresh having 0 build time and JIT compilation of the framework when requested at the edge
	- We're moving to post linux era for deployment. Deno deploy is built of V8 isolates. Which is also the reason why cold starts are so fast. more on V8 isolates [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQxx8Zz5FeE)

	-  Fresh is edge native framework. this mean it was built to work directly with deno deploy and v8 isolates.
		- Deno deploy is a runtime built on top v8 but also has built in native web APIs e.g fetch. So this means fresh is built to work with Deno  directly.
		- Remix can be run on deno deploy but after a compilation step. This means that remix is not "edge native"
