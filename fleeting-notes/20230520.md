rewriting jweidesigns.com with next 13 app dir today some thoughts:


- typing url params stills sucks , there has got to be better way:
  
```jsx
type BlogSlugPageProps = {

params: { slug: string };

};

  

export default function BlogSlugPage({ params }: BlogSlugPageProps) {

const slug = params.slug;

  

return <>Slug page | {slug}</>;

}
```


- you can't "opt out" of global layouts. Instead its important to think about layouts in terms of  [layout groups](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes#route-groups). But how do you wrap the index page into a group? 🤔  

turns out this the more informative doc that explains how route groups work
https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-groups
 - it works by wrapping sections of your UI code into folders named with parenthesis
