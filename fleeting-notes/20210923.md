- Final touches to the new learning site. Having lots of fun with Astro.js, but running into a few niggles around the `Astro` class and using it the frontmatter. All-in-all I'm excited to explore [Astro](/index-notes/Astro.md) in bit more depth.
- Now time to focus on linking my notes up in Obsidian to build my second brain!
