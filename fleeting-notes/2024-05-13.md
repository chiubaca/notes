With the absolute failure of [delete-fullstack-cloudflare](permanent-notes/delete-fullstack-cloudflare.md). I've been exploring Astro.js as a full-stack web dev solution. Especially with the announcement of [Astro Actions](https://astro.build/blog/astro-480/), it feels like Astro can stand its ground against the likes of Next.js. 

New goal, get all these features working together in Astro:

- Cloudflare R2 for images
- Auth (Lucia/ Auth.js)
