- `react-dnd` has a slightly steep learning curve, but the actual usuage of the API is quite nice.

1. first you need to wrap your component around in the `DndProvider` and provide it with the `HTML5Backend` becasue we're working with web pages.

```tsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import { DndProvider } from "react-dnd";
import { HTML5Backend } from "react-dnd-html5-backend";

import "./style.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <DndProvider backend={HTML5Backend}>
      <div class="app-container">....</div>
    </DndProvider>
  );
}

render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

2. Now we have access to the react-dnd hooks like `useDrag` and `useDrop`

- with `useDrag`, we deconstruct the `react-dnd` props in the first item of the array, in this example it
  ```
    const [{ isDragging }, drag] = useDrag(() => ({
      type: 'CARD',
      item: { test: 'test', type: 'CARD' },
      collect: monitor => ({
        isDraggining: !!monitor.isDragging
      })
    }));
  ```
- the first item in the array could be any any arbitary prop which is "collected" by the `collect` callback function.
