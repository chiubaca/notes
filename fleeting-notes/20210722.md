- Trying to get my head around `react-dnd`. Making a start on this [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyx3Ps20TOg)

![where dnd sits between the dom, vdmon and react](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18376481/126670575-326e970d-cd22-4fad-8dba-bb2d1276de35.png)

## Dnd Concepts

- Backends

  - confusingly, not something used in the backend e.g node.js. backend refers to events/intereactions that can be tapped into between the DOM and React-dnd layers. This can include:
    - HTML events
    - touch events
    - testing Dnd interactions
    - Custom backends can also be created!

- Item Types

  - used as a hint for dnd so there information about what the item being dragged on or being dragged is

- Monitors
  - Communicates events from the DOM to React components. This tapped into on the React side via a context.

## Interactions between React

- Collectors

  - these are functions when turn Dnd events coming from `monitors` into react props. This refered to as "collecting props"

- Drag Sources

  - draggable components are known as a drag sources
  - drag sources contain information passed on from drop targets.

- Drop targets
  - components which are areas to things to dropped on are drop targets
  - they can execute function from Dnd events

## Summary

1. there are DOM events
2. these get communicated to Dnd via `monitors`
3. `monitors` are coverted to state which is available to react via a `context`
4. we use collecting functions to covert the state in the context into props- known as "collecting props"
5. we use the props as normally would in any react component
