- Finished the [full stack apollo tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/local-state/)

  - Learnt about how you it possible to use the apollo cache as a state management tool by making use of _Reactive Variables_ via the `makeVar` function. You can define reactive varibles client side like so

  ```
  // Initializes to true if localStorage includes a 'token' key,
  // false otherwise
  export const isLoggedInVar = makeVar<boolean>(!!localStorage.getItem('token'));

  // Initializes to an empty array
  export const cartItemsVar = makeVar<string[]>([]);

  ```

  This can be acessed in Mutation hooks via any of the callback functions simply by calling the name of the reactive var as a function e.g `isLoggedInVar()`

- Need to play around with [`cache.modify`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-interaction/#cachemodify) in more detail. This can let us modify the apollo cache in any way.
