Got totally hook with opencode and rewriting shibes.lol

- migrated the whole db to use better-auth
- added dimiensions to every image in the db
- built out an infinite masonary gallery
- rebuilt the whole admin dashboard for moderation
- migrated the whole app to Tanstack Start

Agentic coding is no joke. I was able to do all this whilst doing all my dad duties and work. I am somehow both terrified and excited of what the future holds.

One thing I know for sure. I can just keep building.
