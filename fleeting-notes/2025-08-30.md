cloudflare workers are fast becasue they run on V8 isloates which are similar to AWS to lambda, but way faster . v8 islolates take 5ms to be created vs lambsas which can take up to 800ms

 worker are cheaper than lambdas becasue you're only billed on execution time ,whereas lambda are charged on total running timeS. This is a big point for AI applications, as most of the time when calling models is waiting for the LLMs to respond.
