Cloudflare workers are fast because they run on V8 isloates which are similar to AWS to lambda, but way faster . v8 islolates take 5ms to be created vs lambsas which can take up to 800ms

 Cloudflare workers are cheaper than lambdas because you're only billed on execution time, whereas lambdas are charged on total running time. This is a big point for AI applications, or any applications which has long waiting times. Lambdas are not efficient or optimised for these types of applications but CF workers are.
