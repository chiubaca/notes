- Keeping learning so much CSS from this shiny [card animation](https://codepen.io/akella/pen/XWYrRmb)

when a div is absolutely positioned and you want it to fill its parent you can use `inset: 0` which is the same as :


```css
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
```

CSS radial gradients can get complicated.  At its most basic its a function that can take as many colour properties as you want and it will distribute it evenly in circular fashion.

```css
  background: radial-gradient(red, green, blue);
```

We can add a percentage that defines each colour's stop points. CSS blends the colours for us.

```css
  background: radial-gradient(red 10%, green 20%, blue 80%);
```

ok, so is also a secret optional preliminary argument too... MDN documents the `radial-gradient` function like so:
```

radial-gradient( [ <ending-shape> || <size> ]? [ at <position> ]? , <color-stop-list> )  

```

`<ending-shape>` - can either be `circle` or `elipse` , `elipse` is basically just a stretched circle to match the aspect ratio of the element it's in.

`<size>` - has four options [documented here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/radial-gradient#values) 
   - `closest-side`
   - `closest-corner`
   - `farthest-side`
   - `farthest-corner` - default

[`<position>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position_value) - defaults to `center` but supports an `x` and `y` . This is the param that we can make dynamic via CSS variable to achieve interesting effects like a spotlight effect 

so our simple CSS radial gradient could now look like this:

```css
  background: radial-gradient(farthest-side circle at var(--x, 0%) var(--y, 10%), red 10%, green 20%, blue 80%);
```
