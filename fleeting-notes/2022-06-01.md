- New project at work might give me an excuse to finally tinker around with NX and storybook.
- First stop, [Nx docs!](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro)
- This was a nice [intro overview to Nx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVKMse-gFBI)
	- any apps can benefit from Nx when code sharing is involved
	- Every package and dependancy can be tracked.
