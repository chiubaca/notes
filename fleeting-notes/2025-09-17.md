Cloudflare queues are really straight forward to setup.
  
1. create the queue in the cf dashboard or via wrangler, and grab the queue name
2. in any given cf worker project, you can define a queue `consumer`, which lets you listen to queue events, which are just arrays of arbitary json which you can define. pairing with zod we can manage complex message types.
3. in any given cf worker you can also define a `producer`  which is the thing that can produce item to place into the queue. when setting up a producer you create a binding which can we called anything. in the Pinecone course we simply call it `QUEUE` , which gives us an worker object which we can use anywhere in our cf worker to create a message like so `c.env.QUEUE.send(queueMessage)`

you can do anything when you receive the message such writing to d1 or invoking something else. queues open up the paradigm of background tasks.
