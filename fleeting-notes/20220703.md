- Committing to using zustand for global state management for shiba swag store. decided it's probably an anti-pattern to share around hooks in global state which is what I was doing with react context providers...  When using zustand keeping things simple with basic primitives seems to be the way

	- encountered some weirdness when using persist middleware which was fixed by this [suggestions](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/issues/938#issuecomment-1141402342)
