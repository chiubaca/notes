Nextjs caching is quite complex, but its realtive well outlined here 
https://nextjs.org/docs/app/deep-dive/caching


key takeaways so far

- shared `fetch` calls which are used in different RSC have memoised response. therefore this fetch:
```js
const dogResp = await fetch(`https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random`);
  const dogJson = await dogResp.json();
```
 would return the same response acrss _all_ react server components that called it.

This is a `react` feature and not a `next.js` feature. Only `GET` requests get memoised. So GQL queries dont have this side effect as GQL queries are made via a `POST` request. The workaround is to wrap these api calls in a `react.cache()` .


 - `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";` is what forces next.js to render the page as a dynamic page other it will statically render it.


There are four levels of caching to be aware of:

|Mechanism|What|Where|Purpose|Duration|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|[Request Memoization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/deep-dive/caching#request-memoization)|Return values of functions|Server|Re-use data in a React Component tree|Per-request lifecycle|
|[Data Cache](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/deep-dive/caching#data-cache)|Data|Server|Store data across user requests and deployments|Persistent (can be revalidated)|
|[Full Route Cache](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/deep-dive/caching#full-route-cache)|HTML and RSC payload|Server|Reduce rendering cost and improve performance|Persistent (can be revalidated)|
|[Router Cache](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/deep-dive/caching#client-side-router-cache)|RSC Payload|Client|Reduce server requests on navigation|User session or time-based|
