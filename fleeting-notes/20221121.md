- Add to calendar functionality is surprisingly nuanced. Best react lib for doing this i've found so far is probably [react-add-to-calendar-hoc](https://github.com/jasonleibowitz/react-add-to-calendar-hoc)

 - You could implement this yourself. That hardest part is creating an API that normalises the construction of the URL params across all calendar providers.
