  new year, new browser. giving [helium](https://helium.computer/) a whirl. I love zen and its blantant plagarism of Arc. But firefox is in such a weird spot right now, its kinda slow and still no PWA support is real bummer. My hand is forced to go with a Chromium based browser and one thats OSS, minimal and privacy focused without the weird crypto stuff is winning me over right now.
