- Second full week complete at NB. Navigating around the new code base a little more confidently now. Feeling pretty comfortable with React. The hard part are the pattern outside of React. I still unsure how graphQL is integrated into the projected, I'm fascinated by the fact that types are auto generated from the queries that generated in the code base. Other complicated part re when third part libs are integrated into the project and wrapper classes are hand rolled. Little mini universes of complexities are created everywhere. These patterns and paradigms take time to master
