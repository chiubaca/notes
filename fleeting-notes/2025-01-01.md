Happy new year! 

Already thinking about all the new things I want to learn and do for this year whilst juggling my new life as a dad...

Some things on my mind:
- Simplify my notes setup to make it _even_ easier to jot notes and write more essays. I like this guide https://stephango.com/vault
- Finish off my big two game. building it has gotten me wanting to learn more about real time systems. I wanna go deeper into websockets and server sent events. 
- building big two has made me want to explore building my own version of pocketbase with better types like convex. Hono.js looks like it could be core pillar to build this.
- I keep want to get better at vim and neovim. I want to build up my dev workflow with this.
