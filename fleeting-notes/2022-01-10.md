 ```ts
import {} from 'styled-components';
import theme from '../theme';

Had a quick look at GraphCMS and it's shockingly similar to PrismicCMS. It's much more GQL orientated which is fine as I would use Prismic with GQL too. 

Like Prismic, they also provide a rich text rendered component with pretty much the exact same API - https://graphcms.com/blog/graphcms-react-rich-text-renderer
