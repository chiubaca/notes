- First time dealing with pagination with GraphCMS and Next.js. With static pagination there are few things to consider.
	- how many items appear per route. 
	- Find the max total of items upfront (this is used to figure out how many buttons and pages should be generated!)
	- all view ports need to have the same amount of items!
