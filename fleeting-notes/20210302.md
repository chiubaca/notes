- Learning some interesting React.js design patterns:

  ## Factory Components

  This is a pattern whereby you create a component which sole purpose is to render more components. There are some clear benifits of creating a factory component which I can think of: - The factory component can contain the logic of how/when a certain is to be rendered. For example if the factory is provided an array of objects as a prop, it could conditionaly on a compoents bases on specfic properties on each object. - It creates a seperation of concern for the logic of how conditionally rendering a component and also the generic component that is being rendered. - When we abstract logic out into a seperate component like this, it makes it easier to optimise the component by wrapping it all in a `React.memo`.

  ## Passing `dispatch` down as prop

  This a bit of mind warp, but once you have setup a `useReducer` in a component it's possible to create child componets that accept the `dispatch` function as a prop. This allows for the child components to mutate the state of the parent component. The tricky thing is knowing what context of the dispatch is in play when using it in the child components.
