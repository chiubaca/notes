- Played around with Vue 3 some more this evening. Bit of trouble with TS enums but it was just an issue with TS linting in the end. Good progress on pomodor front end project. https://fcc-frontend-challenges-vue.netlify.app/#/pomodoro . Funny I remember this challenge being so hard when trying to implement it in React. It feel so elegant writing it with composition functions. I really feels like formulas in excel spreadsheets. weirdly
