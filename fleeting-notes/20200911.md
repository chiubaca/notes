- Setup a new vue project to work through free code camp frontend projects with Vue composition API
- Setup Tailwind in the project too. compound learning.
- Read through tailwind docs and built a calculator design. Initial impression of tailwind is that it's pretty fraustrating, I dont find it that intuitive but that may be becasue I'm quite comfortable with vanilla css. Will perservere to see if I start to enjoy working with it.
