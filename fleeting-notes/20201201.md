- Worked through more [postgres tutorials](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/). Completed `Section 5. Set Operations` unions, interesets and except clauses.
- Got pretty confused working through `Section 6. Grouping sets, Cube, and Rollup` , but [this youtube vide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc6-X6mNv7k) explained it well and I finally grocked it. I just dont understand when you want to have grouped data like that. `CUBE` and `ROLLUP` functions are interesting shortcuts to producing variations of grouped data from your table, but simarly, i just dont know why you would want to work with data like that. seems to makes more sense for it to be seperate queries to me.
