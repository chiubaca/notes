- Tinkering with PrismicCMS today. Prismic builder seems interesting so far. From what I understand you can created resuable UI 'slices' which content authors of prismic can choose to add in themselves. These are not reusable components which we use in development.

- PrismicCMS provide so many API clients...
	- JS client https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/query-api-nextjs
		- HTML serialization: https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/advanced-rich-text-templating-nextjs
	- GQL -  https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/the-graphql-api-explorer

Reading up on Next.js `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`. Nice tutorial https://spacejelly.dev/posts/how-to-create-pages-in-next-js-with-static-dynamic-data/#step-2-using-getstaticprops-to-statically-generate-a-page-with-dynamic-data

Not quite figured how to infer the types when consuming these static props in the component... Interesting suggestions here but nothing I like, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65078245/how-to-make-next-js-getstaticprops-work-with-typescript
