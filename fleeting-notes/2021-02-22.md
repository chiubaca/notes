- Craftmanship beats Passion every time (according to so good they cant ignore you). Becoming "so good they can't ignore" can only happen when you have sunken enough time into the thing you you want be good at. This means whatever we do, we should optimise our time to build upon this skill. This is referred to as "Career Capital". If your job does not optimise for you to grow your career capital, it's probably time to leave.
- Sometimes it's difficult to determine hard parts of your job is the "grind" to getting better or if it is genuinely just a bad job. a.k.a not optimising your career capital. Things to look out for:
  - Your job makes you work people you dont like
  - Your job has negative impact on the world (in your opinion)
  - Your job provides you little oppurtunity to optimise your skills that make you rare and valuable.
