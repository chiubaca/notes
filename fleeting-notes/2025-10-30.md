Finally getting around to learning about cloudflare durable objects. My current mental mode of them and its features.

 - DOs are stateful programable objects which can interface with whole CF ecosystem.
- You can instantiate as many DO as you need and asign a unique ID to reference them
    -  You use `idFromName` to reference your DO
    -  You create a "stub" of your DO with ` which gives you access to all the methods which you defined.
-  A DOs state can be a simple KV store or a sqlite db
