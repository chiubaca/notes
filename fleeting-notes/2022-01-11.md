- Revising GSAP scroll trigger again.  All tutorials generally target DOM elements with `querySelector` , but GSAP works perfect with React refs.
- when installing on a react app/next.js. we need to remember to import `gsap` and `ScrollTrigger`, then finally register the plugin. I _think_ registration only needs to happen once, but it's ok to register multiple times and it will treat it as a singleton.

```
import gsap from 'gsap';

import { ScrollTrigger } from 'gsap/dist/ScrollTrigger';

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);
```
