- Playing around with Figma lot for shiba swag store. Iove how Figma thinks about design from a web development perspective. 
	- Mask in figma are a way to clip one layer with another layer like a cooke cutter effect. The thing to note is the layer you want to use as the "cookie-cutter" needs to be behind the layer your want to cut before you select both layers then click the "mask" button.
