- Thinking a bit about the stack architecture for [building-a-headless-dropshipping-site](../literature-notes/building-a-headless-dropshipping-site.md) ... 
	- After a user has made a purchase to an item, we should store this transaction. 
	- The transaction should store the state ie. `pending` , `failed`  , `paid` 
	- only when the transaction is in paid state we have the funds in our account. Then we can forward the order to printful.

- starting to see the value of something like snipcart. not only does it handle the frontend cart UI, but it also acts a store transactions backend...
