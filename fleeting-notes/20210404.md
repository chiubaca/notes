- Got Prisma and Nexus all wired up, but getting pretty confused about the state of [`nexus-plugin-prisma`](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus-plugin-prisma). My understanding is that it was maintained by nexus but now deprecated to be replaced by [`nexus-prisma`](https://github.com/prisma/nexus-prisma#roadmap), which does not have parity with `nexus-plugin-prisma`, most fundamentally `t.crud` which automagically creates a crud api from your gql scheama.
