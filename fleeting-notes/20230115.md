- Remix pushes you to use `<form/>` to make calls to the server. We're probably more used to using `post` with something like `fetch` or `axios` but remix teaches you of vanilla form actions. When tallied up to an `action` function to process the function server side it makes for a really tidy DX. Interesting form actions work with the browser `<form>`  element which will cause a full page reload. If you need a more SPA feel they also provide a Remix `<Form>` components.
