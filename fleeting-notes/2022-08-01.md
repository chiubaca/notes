- [Spicy take on why not to unit test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGKGb109-I4&t=357s)
	- instead optimise CI to forward fix quickly
	- we should build out applications to fail gracefully so we can identify them quickly
	- unit tests slow down development
	- unit test prevent functionality
	- instead we should focus on build paths rather than block them
	- 100% code coverage is probably stupid
