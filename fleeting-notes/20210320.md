- Weekends are for side projects now ðŸ˜Ž. Worked on Typescript-ify musical OSM. I read through the OSM service logic adding comments and converted it all to TS. Learnt an interesting technique setting off delayed functions to run using `setTimeout`. In the context of the OSM service, it checks the time of the OSM changeset, gives it a small offset relative to the current time, then fires it into a `setTimeout`. The effect is like the data is being streamed in. The technique could also be used to throttle the amount of requests being made to an API.
