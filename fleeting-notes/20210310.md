- Wrapped up on the last project of Full stack React, TS, Node & GraphQL. Got everything I wanted from it in terms of learning about about to setup GraphQL from scratch. was a good bonus to also learn about Redux and TypeORM and has highlighted some gaps in my knowledged around data modelling.

- Hacked about on something [special](https://musical-osm.netlify.app/). Massively inspired by [Trams in Helsinki](https://codepen.io/teropa/pen/mBbPEe). I remember being in total awe seeing that visualisation for the first time. I always said I would create something similar once I got good enough at coding. I feel like a sense of coming full circle after creating this and just in time before starting my new job a full time JavaScript Developer.
