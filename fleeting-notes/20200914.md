- Read through a chapters 15-17 of coding career. already listened to the audio version but was good to reread and follow up in the links.
- faffing around with DNS , cloudflare and domain stuff for yiquin. I really dont understand this part of the web at all. It's definitley a blind spot in my knowledge. I Should try to understand these things better! Perhaps I should play around with my own domain as practice. thinking of purchasing chiuba.ca for my personal blog. could be fun to mess around with it.
