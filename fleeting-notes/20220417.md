- Reading a little on [Stripe vs PayPal](https://zapier.com/blog/stripe-vs-paypal/)

- Settling with PayPal for now. Had a bit of success setting it up in next.js.

	- simply include the js lib via a next.js `Script` component.

	- docs are pretty good https://developer.paypal.com/sdk/js/reference/
	- There's a react wrapper - https://github.com/paypal/react-paypal-js
