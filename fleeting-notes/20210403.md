- More hands on leanring with prisma 2 today. Followed this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivpMErpykRo) to setup up a Next, TS, Prisma, GraphQL and have CRUD operations with Nexus.

  - Next already has an API instance that comes with it so dont need to setup node seperately
  - Prisma doesnt come with shipped with graphql anymore, but we can easily setup graphql with Apollo Server by creating a graphql enpoint in the `pages/api` directory, then add the following boilerplate to a file called `graphql.ts`

  ```ts
  import { ApolloServer } from "apollo-server-micro";
  import { schema } from "src/schema";
  import { createContext } from "src/context";

  const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema,
    context: createContext,
    tracing: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
  });

  const handler = server.createHandler({ path: "/api/graphql" });

  export const config = {
    api: {
      bodyParser: false,
    },
  };

  export default handler;
  ```

  context is factory function which returns an instance of Prisma:

  ```ts
  //createContext.ts
  import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
  const prisma = new PrismaClient();

  export interface context {
    prisma: PrismaClient;
  }

  export function createContext() {
    return {
      prisma,
    };
  }
  ```

  - As Prisma 2 does not come with grapql server anymore and is more a library. This means that it does not come shipped with graphql CRUD operation out of the box. Nexus is a new library which can create these CRUD operations based on an existing schema. It has the ability to create queries and mutations and for a single or mutliple elements.
