- Trying out supabase cli and attempting to create work flow to sync of local dev with hosted environment and having a pretty terrible time:
	- how is branching supposed to work?
	- my dev and remote dev migrations are out of sync, but i have no idea how to fix?
	- do I dev on local and push to remote? or work on remote and sync with local?
    - `supabase db remote changes` takes forever!?

- settling on a much simpler solution to generate type and finally have a chance to use [zx](https://github.com/google/zx) to write bash with javascript. it's so good!

settling on this
```js
import "zx/globals";
require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env.local" });
  

const SB_PROJECT_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL;
const SB_ANON_KEY = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

await $`npx openapi-typescript ${SB_PROJECT_URL}/rest/v1/?apikey=${SB_ANON_KEY} --output types/supabase.ts`;

```
