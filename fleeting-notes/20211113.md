- Back on Three.js journey and learning about about scroll based animations.
   - Working with `THREE.MeshToonMaterial` is quite fun. It creates a cel-shaded cartoon effect. Its important thats it's used along with a texture file.
       - A texture file is simply an image file with some pixels that define the colour ramp
    - the texture also needs to have it's `magFilter` set to `THREE.NearestFilter` which can be used for the `gradientMap` for `MeshToonMaterial`.

```js
// Texture
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const gradientTexture = textureLoader.load("textures/gradients/5.jpg");
gradientTexture.magFilter = THREE.NearestFilter;

// Material
const material = new THREE.MeshToonMaterial({
  color: parameters.materialColor,
  gradientMap: gradientTexture,
});

```
