- Made a real start on [building-a-headless-dropshipping-site](../literature-notes/building-a-headless-dropshipping-site.md) . Referencing https://github.com/notrab/headless-dropshipping-starter a lot. 
	- Discovered the same author also made a js wrapper for accessing the printful REST API - https://github.com/notrab/printful-request
	- Got my store appearing on my custom next.js frontend. http://json2ts.com/ to rescue again. The headless-dropping-starter is not very well typed, so spent quite a bit of time studying the interfaces from the printful REST API.
