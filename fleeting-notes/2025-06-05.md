  Learning some cool things about Cloudflare workers as I try to preserve note.chiubaca.com as part of my blog rebuild.
  
  I don't need to maintain another astro project for my notes and my main blog _AND_ have a sub-domain for my notes


note.chiubaca.com can be a worker that proxies a request from chiubaca.com/fleeting-notes. this is such a eureka moment for me.

It's quite nuanced though as we also need to proxy all the CSS and JS that comes along with it. This is where I've learnt about  [Document `<base>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/base) where all ur website relative urls can reference a different website.

To inject this tag we can use Cloudflare [`HTMLRewriter`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/html-rewriter/) to inject this into the response which we proxied across, though, as we also need to proxy all the CSS and JS
