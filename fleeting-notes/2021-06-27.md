- I still db modelling confusing but prisma is helping a lot, this is the syntax i need to remember:

```gql

model Link {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  description String
  url         String
  postedBy    User?    @relation(fields: [postedById], references: [id])
  postedById  Int?
}

model User {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name     String
  email    String @unique
  password String
  links    Link[]
}
```

`Link` has a relation to `User` . `Link` uses the `postedById` feild to reference an item in the `User` table via its `id` feild in the `User` table.

- [Such a great chapter about implementing authorisation with graphql + node](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/6-authentication/)

These are touch points when adding a new table and graphql api endpoint

- update the `prisma.schema`
- run `npx prisma migrate dev` to update the prisma db
- run `npx prisma generate` to update the prisma client libs
- update the `schema.graphql` file to include any new mutation definitions.
  - Add the signature of any new types.
  - Update any existing types which may rely on the new type
- implement any new mutation resolvers
- Implement any new type resolvers
- Update any existing type resolvers which depend on the new type resolver
- remember to export new mutation and resolvers and include in the `ApolloServer` instance
