- [Learning lots from](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-setup-full-stack-apollo-gql-codegen-prisma-2-0-typescript-react-part-1-the-backend-e9eae9518dc9)

  - prisma 2 schema auto completion rocks! but it auto completes with `PascalCase` watch out for that!
  - placing the `prisma` instance into the `ApolloServer` `context` is a good idea! it means that when we create our mutations and resolvers we have access to prisma via context e.g `prisma.context`.
  - The real magic is when when combine the prisma autogenerated types with `GraphQL Code Generator`

    - We can tell the codegen also use a custom interface which defines the `context`.
    - ```

      ```
    - overwrite: true
      schema: "http://localhost:4000"
      generates:
      src/generated/graphql.ts:
      plugins: - "typescript" - "typescript-resolvers"
      config:
      contextType: ../context#Context
      useIndexSignature: true
      ```

      ```
    - When then use the Resolvers types in our code like so, we have full prisma auto completion on the `context` argument.
    - ```
       import { Resolvers } from "./generated/graphql";

         export const resolvers: Resolvers = {
           Query: {
             AllPosts: async (_, args, context) => {
             },
           },
           Mutation: {
             AddPost: async (_, args, context) => {},
             LikePost: async (_, args, context) => {},
           },
         };
      ```
