- tinkering around with how medusa plugins work. They effectively let you isolate logic which has a specific purpose whilst still giving you the full hooks and features of the medusa server, the core building blocks we can work with are:
	- the `api`  these custom URL endpoints which can run any arbitrary code when hit
	- the `service`, the most important aspect which is a class in that you can implement custom business logic in methods. Medusa exposes these methods to all aspects of your plugin including the `api` and `loaders`
	- finally, `loader` from what I understand is a functionality that you can call on a certain lifecycle. such as the startup of the plugin. You can even time to run via a cron job. - https://docs.medusajs.com/advanced/backend/cron-jobs/create/#2-create-cron-job

- plugins are faff to work with right now, so I'm working around it by developing against a medusa server. the process of extracting this logic out of medusa server and and into a plugin looks straight forward though as extending a medusa server and plugin have the same directory structure. Keeping an eye on the following github issues:
	- https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/issues/2486
	- https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/issues/1859
	- https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/pull/1860
