- when working with apollo, you dont need to be 'smart' about reusing state which you already have and try to pass it around.

  1. this cause things to not be reactive as you might expect
  2. too much local state is kinda hard to reason about after a while

- Apollo has cache which it taps into which means a fetch may not necessarily go over the network. But from a dev standpoint we be quite liberal about continuously running refetches on the client.
