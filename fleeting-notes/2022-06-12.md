- Going made trying to assert non nulls with typescript as `Array.filter` is not good enough.

- Reading about predicate, but still struggled a lot.
	- https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates
	- https://www.benmvp.com/blog/filtering-undefined-elements-from-array-typescript/ 

	- This was the winning solution:
```ts
function isNonNull<T>(val: T | null | undefined): val is T {

	return val !== null && val !== undefined;

}

const cleanupNullsinArray = cleanupNulls.filter(isNonNull);

```
