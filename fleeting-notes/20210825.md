- Started the first real coding excercise of threejs journey. starting slow with the basics.
- Basics of a scene. we need a `scene` , `geometry` and `material`. We combine the `geometry` and `material` together to make a `mesh` which can be added a to a scene.

- Next we need a `camera` that also needs to be added to the scene
  - the camera needs to be configured to have an FOV and aspect ratio.
  - the camera has a position property where you can configure the x,y,z position of the camera
- Finally the scene and camera needs to be placed onto a `renderer`. There are many types of renderers but the main one is `THREE.WebGLRenderer`
