Nerd sniped myself trying to drop pocketbase as my realtime db. A sort of simpler hacky alternative has been to use server sent events. I've gotten something working by combining hono.js , drizzle orm and sqlite. hono.js makes it really easy to create a sse endpoint, drizzle gives me TS QOL and sqllite lite will just make deploying things easier.


1. within my insertion POST hono endpoint i emit an insert event along with the data payload
2. within my sse endpoint, its listening to events in step one
3. when an event is received, the sse endpoint will write to the SSE stream.
