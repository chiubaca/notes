- More react and MUI fun. Teasing out what the art of the possible with MUI react component. I've been able to bend it to my will so far, and only feels a little hacky. I still prefer coding with "low-level" css for the control, but I totally get we would give up that control to move quicker. The trade-off is not so clear when a MUI component does not do 100% what you want. Should you try and hack around MUI, or just eject out entirely?
