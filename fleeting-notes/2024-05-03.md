Shiki is the code, highlighter built into Astro,


One challenge i've had a for a long time is code block line highlighting, but Shiki paired with [`transformerNotationHighlight`]([@shikijs/transformers | Shiki](https://shiki.style/packages/transformers#transformernotationhighlight)) it should be possible!
