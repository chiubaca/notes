- The equivalent of React refs in Svelte is [bind:this={domElement}](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/bind-this)

- Even through the Svelte API is amazing and way more easier to integrate with third party libs like mapbox. Came to conclusion I wasnt ready to use svelte kit yet just due to the fact there was a few thing I wasnt clued up on. e.g I dont understand
	-  how [+page.server.js](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#page-page-server-js) work with `use:enhance`. (interesting [others](https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/tbncaz/comment/i0o9mxi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) found it confusing too.
