- Thinking about making OS-like experiences and I've gone from Astro to Svelte and back to Astro again. I think I've cracked the "installation" mechanism. This lets me "install" an app which is using any front-end framework all loads lazily thanks to how Astro works. This opens up the ability to build my digital garden of random hacks which is only restricted by Astro adapters.
