spent HOURS figuring this out. turns out you cant make fetch request from worker to another e.g `https://website.chiubaca.workers.dev` cant make fetch call to `https://backend.chiubaca.workers.dev`. it will fail with  `error code: 1042`, apprently for [security reasons](). The workaround is to bind a custom domain to a worker, which puts it into a different zone.

Advanced workaround is to make use of [service-to-service bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/service-bindings/), which can place your workers so they have direct communication with each other have have zero latency.
