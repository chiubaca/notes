- Worked through- [Tutorial: How To Setup Your Local Node.js Development Environment Using Docker pt1](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-setup-your-local-node-js-development-environment-using-docker/) & [Tutorial: How To Setup Your Local Node.js Development Environment Using Docker pt2](https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-setup-your-local-node-js-development-environment-using-docker-part-2/). Lots to take in such as networks and volumes and orchestrating it all with docker compose. All the tutorials I have done so far seemed to be orientated around micro-services which is probably why I have been able to go so long without needing to touch docker. I think i understand the basics. I just dont have a real world project to practise on... I feel like Lambdas and serverless have everything I need. I may not need docker for anything personally, so there is a chance I will forget all of this again.
- Revising my SQL fundamentals again, i think this will help me build better apps with supabase. Running postgres in docker just for good practice. Great learning resource at https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/ . Completed `Section 1. Querying Data`.
- read a few more pages of Essentialism. Feels like i'm reading Atomic Habbits
