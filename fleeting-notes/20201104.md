- Completed the first chapter of clean code. I already apply alot of the rules about descriptive function names and variable intent. good to have these conventions validated.
- Read a few more pages of Essentialism. Taking in some points about essentialism mindset. ask myself if things are important? if not why am i doing it? reminds me of marie kondo . "does it spark joy?" lol.
