- Learning about lighting in three.js
- There's a lot of different light sources available and positioning them will take experimentation. Make use of the THREE light helpers which visualise where the light source is coming from combined with `dat.GUI` to quickly move the light sources around.
- Lights sources come at a computational cost and should be used sparingly

    Minimal cost:

        AmbientLight
        HemisphereLight

    Moderate cost:

        DirectionalLight
        PointLight

    High cost:

        SpotLight
        RectAreaLight

- Consider `Baking`
  > A good technique for lighting is called baking. The idea is that you bake the light into the texture. This can be done in a 3D software. Unfortunately, you won't be able to move the lights, because there are none and you'll probably need a lot of textures.
