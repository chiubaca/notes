- Survived the first week at my new job! Feels good to be coding full time and I'm starting to get to grips with React a lot more. Coded my first React hook today and working through some tricky routing logic, but it's all coming together! Lots of things I need to learn and continue to improve on.
  - Writing idomatic React, understand the rules of hooks. Various Nauiaces of React.
  - a11y and the WCAG spec.
  - Various react libs, Snack-provider, Helmet, type-routes.
