- lots research into snippcart vs alternatives. Everyone wants a slice of the pie when it comes to eccomerce!
    - snipcart charges 2% of every transaction but:
      > *For clients with monthly sales under $ 629 CAD, the 2% will be replaced by a $ 13 CAD monthly fee. Note that you'll be charged in USD.
  
     - shopify lite seems to be the only other interesting competitor but still not doing exactly what snipcart do with regards to a "headless" shopping cart which also integrates with other services.

struggling to really understand why we have these middle-men aside from the fact they handle tricky parts like VAT and linking up payment gateways. snipcart also has some other added benifits like analytics and empty shopping cart strategies...
