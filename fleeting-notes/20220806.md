Reading through the [next.js layouts RFC pt 1](https://nextjs.org/blog/layouts-rfc) .My current mental model:
	- There will be a new `/app` directory which can used to incrementally port over component pages from `/pages`.
	- at the root of the `app` we can define a `layouts.tsx` file which will nest all components. This replaces `_app.tsx` and `_documents.tsx` . `getStacticProps` and `getServerSideProps` works here which open up the ability for fetching global data across your website without needing to run the data request on every page. 
	- Folder based routing still existing, but `index.tsx`  will now need to be named `page.tsx` . This means we can colocated test files and other things without needing the page extensions API. You can also provide a `layout.tsx` in each nested route which will be nested in its parents layout.
	- There appears to be no API to override the layout right now?
	- all components will be [react server components](https://github.com/josephsavona/rfcs/blob/server-components/text/0000-server-components.md) by default. This opens up the ability to run `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` on component!? (need to verify this)
