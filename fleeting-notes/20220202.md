- Not strictly zero days the last couple of day. Been working like crazy for work for a tight deadline! I've learnt so many things , mainly niche safari things
    - dont use css `gap`
    - power saving mode causes all videos to pause and look ugly
    - `webkit-box` is not standard but fixes things?!

- Also just accelerated my mentoring, TS and React skills recently.
