- Good video on [a11y and html](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NexL5_Vdoq8) 
   - only use one `h1` on a page
   - think of using `h` tags to structure the order of your page like a text book. but not in regards to styling
   - `h` tags should work downwards sequentially
   - it's ok to use multiple `header` and `nav` tags
   - sematic html creates landmarks that make it easier to skip over section for screen readers.

- fun course on creating a three.js galaxy. The the technique entails builing a factory function which generates  a bunch of particles based on a config. This seems to be a nice pattern to keep things tidy.
    - so much maths required in order to generate randomness and curvature of particles... ðŸ˜• Needs to learn more about . Do i need to relearn `sin` `cos` and `tan` again?

- types arrays still confuse the heck out of me . but this what i understand so far
   - they act as an array to store a collections of specfic bytes
   - they're used in conjunction with an `ArrayBuffer`
   - you cant access an `ArrayBuffer` directly. Instead you need to use a `DataView`
