- Messing around with the weird idea in Svelte kit
	- Render all Hacker news link URLs
	- Render article URL in an Iframe
	- Invert the colour of the page with CSS to have a dark mode on all articles which doesn't support it!
In conclusion, it works! but learnt that a website can deny their site being renderable on a website with `X-Frame-Options: DENY` 
	- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options

There are interesting [hacks](https://github.com/niutech/x-frame-bypass) around this to bypass the X-Frame settings. But probs not a good idea. The better solution would be to pre-render a website server side and proxy the content on your own domain.I assume this is how something like a [pocket](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/pocket/) works.
